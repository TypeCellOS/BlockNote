# Rendering static documents

This example shows how you can use HTML exported using the `blocksToFullHTML` and render it as a static document (a view-only document, without the editor). You can use this for example if you use BlockNote to edit blog posts in a CMS, but want to display non-editable static, published pages to end-users.
