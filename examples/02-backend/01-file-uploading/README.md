# Upload Files

This example allows users to upload files and use them in the editor. The files are uploaded to [/TMP/Files](https://tmpfiles.org/), and can be used for File, Image, Video, and Audio blocks.

**Try it out:** Click the "Add Image" button and see there's now an "Upload" tab in the toolbar!
