# Saving & Loading

This example shows how to save the editor contents to local storage whenever a change is made, and load the saved contents when the editor is created.

You can replace the `saveToStorage` and `loadFromStorage` functions with calls to your backend or database.

**Try it out:** Try typing in the editor and reloading the page!
