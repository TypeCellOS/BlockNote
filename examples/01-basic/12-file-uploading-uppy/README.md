# Uploading Files with Uppy

This example allows users to upload files using [Uppy](https://uppy.io/) and use them in the editor.

Uppy is highly extensible and has an extensive ecosystem of plugins. For example, you can:

- record audio, screen or webcam
- import files from Box / Dropbox / Facebook / Google Drive / Google Photos / Instagram / OneDrive / Zoom
- select files from Unsplash
- show an image editor (crop, rotate, etc)

(in this example, we've enabled the Webcam, ScreenCapture and Image Editor plugin)

**Try it out:** Click the "Add Image" button and you can either drop files or click "browse files" to upload them.
