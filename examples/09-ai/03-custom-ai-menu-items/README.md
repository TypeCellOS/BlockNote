# Adding AI Menu Items

In this example, we add two items to the AI Menu. The first prompts the AI to make the selected text more casual, and can be found by selecting some text and click the AI (stars) button. The second prompts the AI to give ideas on related topics to extend the document with, and can be found by clicking the "Ask AI" Slash Menu item.

Select some text and click the AI (stars) button, or type `/ai` anywhere in the editor to access AI functionality.
