# Code Block Syntax Highlighting

To enable code block syntax highlighting, you can extend the editor's default schema with a new `codeBlock`, which you can pass options into when creating. By passing the default options from `@blocknote/code-block`, you can enable syntax highlighting. This is excluded by default to reduce bundle size.
