# Grid Mentions Menu

In this example, we create a custom `Mention` inline content type which is used to tag people. In addition, we create a new Suggestion Menu for mentions which opens with the "@" character. This Suggestion Menu is displayed as a grid of 2 columns, where each item is the first letter of the person's name.

**Try it out:** Press the "@" key to open the mentions menu and insert a mention!
