# Uppy File Panel

This example allows users to upload files using [Uppy](https://uppy.io/) by replacing the default File Panel with an Uppy Dashboard.

Uppy is highly extensible and has an extensive ecosystem of plugins. For example, you can:

- Record audio, screen or webcam
- Import files from Box / Dropbox / Facebook / Google Drive / Google Photos / Instagram / OneDrive / Zoom
- Select files from Unsplash
- Show an image editor (crop, rotate, etc)

In this example, we've enabled the Webcam, ScreenCapture and Image Editor plugins.

**Try it out:** Click the "Add Image" button and you can either drop files or click "browse files" to upload them.
