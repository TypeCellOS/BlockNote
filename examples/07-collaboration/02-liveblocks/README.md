# Collaborative Editing with Liveblocks

In this example, we use follow
the [Liveblocks + BlockNote setup guide](https://liveblocks.io/docs/get-started/react-blocknote)
to create a collaborative BlockNote editor, where multiple people can work on
the same document in real-time.

Users can also add comments to the documents to start threads, which are
displayed next to the editor. As well as that, they can react to, reply to, and
resolve existing comments.

**Try it out:** Open this page in a new browser tab or window to see it in
action!
