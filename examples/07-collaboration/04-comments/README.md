# Threads Sidebar View

This is another example showcasing threads and comments. However, instead of
showing threads floating within the editor, we instead display them in a
separate
sidebar using the `ThreadsSidebar` component.

**Try it out:** Click the "Add comment" button in
the [Formatting Toolbar](/docs/ui-components/formatting-toolbar) to add a
comment!
