# Collaborative Editing Features Showcase

In this example, you can play with all of the collaboration features BlockNote has to offer:

**Comments**: Add comments to parts of the document - other users can then view, reply to, react to, and resolve them.

**Versioning**: Save snapshots of the document - later preview saved snapshots and restore them to ensure work is never lost.

**Suggestions**: Suggest changes directly in the editor - users can choose to then apply or reject those changes.
