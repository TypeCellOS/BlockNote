# Threads Sidebar

In this example, you can add comments to the document while collaborating with others. You can also pick user accounts with different permissions, as well as react to, reply to, and resolve existing comments. The comments are displayed floating next to the text they refer to, and appear when selecting said text. The comments are shown in a separate sidebar using the `ThreadsSidebar` component.

**Try it out:** Click the "Add comment" button in
the [Formatting Toolbar](/docs/ui-components/formatting-toolbar) to add a
comment!
