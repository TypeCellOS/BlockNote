# Mission

BlockNote’s mission is to make it easy for developers to embed a modern, high-quality rich-text editing experience into their applications, while maximizing developer control.

## Vision

BlockNote aims to be the most trusted open foundation for rich-text editing in modern web applications.

BlockNote enables editing experiences comparable to industry leaders, while remaining fully open, developer-controlled, and adaptable to a wide range of use cases. We aim for long-term maintainability, extensibility, and collaboration across a diverse ecosystem of applications.

## How the Mission Guides Decisions

The mission is not only descriptive; it is intended to guide decision‑making across the project.

When evaluating ideas, RFCs, prioritization decisions, or technical changes, maintainers, Product, and the Technical Steering Committee (TSC) are expected to consider the following questions:

- Does this improve the developer experience of integrating and using BlockNote?
- Does this contribute to a high-quality and accessible end-user editing experience when integrated into an application?
- Does this preserve or enhance the extensible, modular, and developer-controlled nature of the library?
- Does this align with a modern, block-based editing model?
- Does this preserve or enhance collaborative editing experiences?

Proposals that clearly align with the mission are more likely to be accepted. Proposals that conflict with the mission may be declined or redirected, even if they are technically feasible.
