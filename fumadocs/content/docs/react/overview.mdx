## Quick Start

The fastest way to get started with the React bindings is by using the `useCreateBlockNote` hook and `BlockNoteView` component:

```tsx twoslash
import React from "react";
import { useCreateBlockNote } from "@blocknote/react";
import { BlockNoteView } from "@blocknote/mantine";
// Or ariakit, shadcn, etc.

function MyEditor() {
  const editor = useCreateBlockNote();

  return <BlockNoteView editor={editor} />;
}
```

That's it! You now have a fully functional editor with all the basic features like:

- Text editing and formatting
- Block types (paragraphs, headings, lists, etc.)
- Toolbar for formatting options
- Side menu for block operations

## Examples

### Adding Initial Content

You can start your editor with some predefined content:

```tsx twoslash
import React from "react";
import { useCreateBlockNote } from "@blocknote/react";
import { BlockNoteView } from "@blocknote/mantine";

// ---cut---
function EditorWithContent() {
  const editor = useCreateBlockNote({
    initialContent: [
      {
        type: "heading",
        content: "Welcome to BlockNote",
        props: { level: 1 },
      },
      {
        type: "paragraph",
        content: "This is a paragraph with some text.",
      },
      {
        type: "bulletListItem",
        content: "This is a bullet point",
      },
    ],
  });

  return <BlockNoteView editor={editor} />;
}
```

### Handling Changes

You can listen for changes in your editor content:

```tsx twoslash
import React from "react";
import { BlockNoteEditor } from "@blocknote/core";
import { useCreateBlockNote } from "@blocknote/react";
import { BlockNoteView } from "@blocknote/mantine";

// ---cut---
function EditorWithHandlers() {
  const editor = useCreateBlockNote();

  const handleChange = (editor: BlockNoteEditor<any, any, any>) => {
    // Get the current content as JSON
    const content = editor.document;
    console.log("Content changed:", content);
  };

  return <BlockNoteView editor={editor} onChange={handleChange} />;
}
```

### Customizing the Appearance

You can customize the editor's appearance with themes and styling:

```tsx twoslash
import React from "react";
import { useCreateBlockNote } from "@blocknote/react";
import { BlockNoteView } from "@blocknote/mantine";

// ---cut---
function StyledEditor() {
  const editor = useCreateBlockNote();

  return (
    <div
      style={{ border: "1px solid #ccc", borderRadius: "8px", padding: "16px" }}
    >
      <BlockNoteView
        editor={editor}
        theme="dark"
        style={{ minHeight: "300px" }}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Next Steps

Now that you have a basic editor working, you can explore:

- [Block Types](/docs/block-types) - Learn about different content blocks
- [Formatting](/docs/formatting) - Customize text and block formatting
- [Customization](/docs/customization) - Build custom UI components
- [Examples](/examples) - See more advanced usage patterns

The editor is now ready to use! Start typing and explore the various block types and formatting options available in the toolbar.
