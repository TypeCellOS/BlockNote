BlockNote allows you to add custom HTML attributes to various DOM elements within the editor. This gives you fine-grained control over styling and functionality.

## Available DOM Elements

The following DOM elements can receive custom attributes:

- **`editor`**: The main editor container, excluding menus & toolbars
- **`block`**: The container element for individual blocks
- **`blockGroup`**: Wrapper for top-level and nested blocks
- **`blockContent`**: Wrapper for a block's content
- **`inlineContent`**: Wrapper for rich-text content within blocks

## Example Usage

The demo below shows how to add a custom class to the `block` element to create a border around each block:

<Example name="theming/theming-dom-attributes" />
