# Adding DOM Attributes

You can set additional HTML attributes on a number of DOM elements inside the editor. There include:

`editor:` The editor itself, excluding menus & toolbars.

`block:` The main container element for blocks. Contains both the block's content and its nested blocks.

`blockGroup:` The wrapper element for all top-level blocks in the editor and nested blocks.

`blockContent:` The wrapper element for a block's content.

`inlineContent:` The wrapper element for a block's rich-text content.


In the demo below, we set a custom class on the `block` element to add a border to each block:
