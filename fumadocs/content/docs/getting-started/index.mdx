Getting started with BlockNote is quick and easy. Install the required packages and add the React component to your app.

## Install

To install BlockNote with [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm), run:

```console tab="npm"
npm install @blocknote/core @blocknote/react @blocknote/mantine
```

```console tab="pnpm"
pnpm add @blocknote/core @blocknote/react @blocknote/mantine
```

```console tab="bun"
bun add @blocknote/core @blocknote/react @blocknote/mantine
```

## Creating an Editor

With the `useCreateBlockNote` hook, we can create a new editor instance, then use the`BlockNoteView` component to render it. See below:

<Example name="basic/minimal" />

We also import `@blocknote/mantine/style.css` to add default styling for the editor and the `Inter` font that BlockNote exports (optional).

<Callout

  title="Next.js usage (or other server-side React frameworks)"
>
  Are you using Next.js (`create-next-app`)? Because BlockNote is a client-only
  component, make sure to disable server-side rendering of BlockNote. [Read our
  guide on setting up Next.js + BlockNote](/docs/nextjs)
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" title="Using BlockNote without React">
  It's also possible to use BlockNote without React, using "vanilla" JavaScript
  or other frameworks. [Read our guide on using BlockNote without
  React](/docs/vanilla-js)

## Next steps

You now know how to integrate BlockNote into your React app! However, this is just scratching the surface of what you can do with BlockNote.

- Learn about [blocks and the editor basics](/docs/editor-basics) and how to interact with the editor using the [editor API](/docs/editor-api)
- See [UI Components](/docs/ui-components) to customize built-in menus and toolbars and [Styling & Theming](/docs/styling-theming) to customize the look and feel of the editor
- Further extend the editor with your own Blocks using [Custom Schemas](/docs/custom-schemas) or add [Real-Time Collaboration](/docs/advanced/real-time-collaboration)
