You can customize your editor when you instantiate it. Let's take a closer looks at the basic methods and components to set up your BlockNote editor.

## `useCreateBlockNote` hook

Create a new `BlockNoteEditor` by calling the `useCreateBlockNote` hook. This instantiates a new editor and its required state. You can later interact with the editor using the Editor API and pass it to the `BlockNoteView` component.

```tsx
import { useCreateBlockNote, BlockNoteView } from "@blocknote/react";

function MyEditor() {
  // Creates a new BlockNoteEditor instance
  const editor = useCreateBlockNote({
    initialContent: [
      {
        type: "paragraph",
        content: "Hello, world!",
      },
    ],
    sideMenuDetection: "editor",
  });

  return <BlockNoteView editor={editor} />;
}
```

The hook takes two optional parameters:

**options:** An object containing options for the editor:

**deps:** Dependency array that's internally passed to `useMemo`. A new editor will only be created when this array changes.

  <strong>Manually creating the editor (`BlockNoteEditor.create`)</strong>
  <p>
    The `useCreateBlockNote` hook is actually a simple `useMemo` wrapper around
    the `BlockNoteEditor.create` method. You can use this method directly if you
    want to control the editor lifecycle manually. For example, we do this in
    the [Saving & Loading example](/examples/backend/saving-loading) to delay
    the editor creation until some content has been fetched from an external
    data source.

### Options

There are a number of options you can pass to the `BlockNoteEditor` constructor. You can find the full list of these below:

<auto-type-table
  path="../../../../packages/core/src/editor/BlockNoteEditor.ts"
  name="BlockNoteEditorOptions"
/>

## Rendering the Editor with `<BlockNoteView>`

Use the `<BlockNoteView>` component to render the `BlockNoteEditor` instance you just created:

```tsx
import { BlockNoteView, useCreateBlockNote } from "@blocknote/react";

function MyEditor() {
  const editor = useCreateBlockNote();

  // Renders the editor
  return (
    <BlockNoteView
      editor={editor}
      theme="light"
      onSelectionChange={handleSelectionChange}
      onChange={handleChange}
      children={
        <div>
          <h1>My Child Component</h1>
        </div>
      }
    />
  );
}
```

### Props

There are a number of additional props you can pass to `BlockNoteView`. You can find the full list of these below:

<auto-type-table
  path="../../../../packages/react/src/editor/BlockNoteView.tsx"
  name="BlockNoteViewProps"
/>

Additional props passed are forwarded to the HTML `div` element BlockNote renders internally.

  <strong>Uncontrolled component</strong>
  <p>
    Note that the `BlockNoteView` component is an [uncontrolled component](https://react.dev/learn/sharing-state-between-components#controlled-and-uncontrolled-components). 
    This means you don't pass in the editor content directly as a prop. You can use the `initialContent` option in the `useCreateBlockNote` hook to set the initial content of the editor (similar to the `defaultValue` prop in a regular React `<textarea>`).
  </p>
  <p>
    BlockNote handles the complexities and performance optimizations of managing editor state internally. You can interact with the editor content using the [Editor API](/docs/editor-api).
