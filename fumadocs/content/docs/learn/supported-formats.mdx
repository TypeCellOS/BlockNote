When it comes to editors, formats can be tricky. The editor needs to be able to both read and write to each format.

### Lossy Conversions

If elements are not preserved in this transformation, we call the conversion _lossy_. While we'd ideally support every format, there are limitations to consider:

- Some formats may not support certain types of content
- Maintaining multiple parsers and serializers creates additional complexity

We aim for full interoperability with our supported formats, though this isn't always possible. Where conversions may lose data, we indicate this through method names like:

- `editor.tryParseHTMLToBlocks`
- `editor.blocksToMarkdownLossy`
- `editor.blocksToHTMLLossy`

And when we are confident that the conversion is lossless (only the case for BlockNote JSON &lt;-&gt; BlockNote HTML), we use the following method names:

- `editor.blocksToFullHTML`

## Supported Formats

### Import & Export

BlockNote supports these formats for both importing and exporting content:

- JSON (BlockNote JSON format)
  - Accessible via `editor.document`
- HTML
  - BlockNote Internal HTML format
    - Accessible via `editor.blocksToFullHTML()` and `editor.tryParseHTMLToBlocks()`
  - Standard HTML (for interoperability with other tools)
    - Accessible via `editor.blocksToHTMLLossy()` and `editor.tryParseHTMLToBlocks()`
- Markdown
  - Accessible via `editor.blocksToMarkdownLossy()` and `editor.tryParseMarkdownToBlocks()`

### Export Only

BlockNote can also export to these additional formats:

- DOCX
  - Via the [`@blocknote/xl-docx-exporter` package](/features/export/docx)
- PDF
  - Via the [`@blocknote/xl-pdf-exporter` package](/features/export/pdf)
- ODT
  - Via the [`@blocknote/xl-odt-exporter` package](/features/export/odt)
