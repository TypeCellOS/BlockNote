BlockNote editor options are passed to the `BlockNoteEditor` constructor.

<auto-type-table
  path="../../../../packages/core/src/editor/BlockNoteEditor.ts"
  name="BlockNoteEditorOptions"
/>

## BlockNoteView Props

There are a number of additional props you can pass to `BlockNoteView`. You can find the full list of these below:

<auto-type-table
  path="../../../../packages/react/src/editor/BlockNoteView.tsx"
  name="BlockNoteViewProps"
/>

Additional props passed are forwarded to the HTML `div` element BlockNote renders internally.
