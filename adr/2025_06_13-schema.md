# BlockNote Schema

Right now it is overly burdensome to have to pass around 3 different types to the editor, and it is also not very type-safe (when you just end up with `any` everywhere).

The idea is to have a single type that is a union of the 3 types, and then make type predicates available to check if accessed properties are valid (and likely just assertions too).

You'll see some of what I came up with in the `Schema.ts` file.

You'll also notice that the default blocks, inline content, styles, and groups are all defined in the `@blocknote/core/blocks` package. This is assuming that we have already moved them to the blocknote API and out of the core package.

## Groups

In a somewhat similar vein, I think there might be use for having an indirection layer for referring to specific blocks, inline content, styles, etc. Reason being that it allows callers to refer to a group of things with a single identifier, and allow customizing that membership by just modifying that group.

Examples include:

- Keyboard shortcuts can refer to a group of blocks/inline-content/styles without modification to the handler
- Relationships between blocks/inline-content/styles can be defined (e.g. allow for a todo block to only have todo item children)
- Properties of blocks/inline-content/styles can be defined (e.g. adding `heading` to the `toggleable` group)

This may or may not be useful, but it is a thought.
