# Storing changes as _patches_ to a document

Say that you kept a separate note where you write what your changes would be. For example, you could probably write on your note, "change paragraph #2 to be paragraph #5", and apply this patch at a later date, assuming the content did not change.

![Suggestions as patches](./images/doc+suggestions_patch.png)

This is sort of along the lines of what Prosemirror suggests, to track changes in a separate data structure and attempt to apply the change at a later point if possible. This is the essence of the idea of Operational Transforms(OT).

## Implementation Details

One easy implementation of this is to have a suggestion be a serialization of a [Prosemirror Transform](https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/#transform). This transform can be [rebased](https://prosemirror.net/docs/guide/#transform.rebasing) through document transformations, to ensure that it's positions are not invalidated. Unfortunately, using this with the current y-prosemirror implementation, makes this approach untenable, as the positions will almost immediately be invalidated. A workaround may be to explore using [relative positions](https://docs.yjs.dev/api/relative-positions) as the anchors to reference for these positions instead of the absolute positions that prosemirror uses. But, this would require some research & testing.

### Pros

- This stores only the minimal representation of a change
- Since it is stored separately
  - it is not possible to be "lost" due to changes in the editor content.
  - it can be permission-ed separately

### Cons

The main drawback of this approach is that it is significantly different from the approach we'd use for diffing versions of documents. Meaning that we'd have to come up with a different approach for storing the changes. Even so, relative positions also have some edge cases that we'd have to consider.

- This stores the change in a separate data structure, which would need to be either maintained by mapping new positions through, or using relative positions.
- Being in a different data structure presents risk for being invalidated by changes to the document (which may not have been intentional).  Imagine moving a paragraph that had a suggestion on it, it could result in the suggestion pointing into an element which no longer exists.
