    question: "Is BlockNote Pro a different library than BlockNote?",
    answer: `"BlockNote Pro" is not an additional library, but instead a subscription service built around the open-source BlockNote library.
       With your subscription, you are ensuring the sustainable maintenance and development of BlockNote and make sure it stays up-to-date under an open source license. 
       You'll also get prioritized support, feature requests, and access to Pro examples.`,
  },
  {
    question: "What payment methods do you accept?",
    answer: `BlockNote Pro is fully integrated with GitHub Sponsors, which means invoicing and payment is handled by GitHub.
    If you require a different payment method, please contact us.`,
  },
  {
    question:
      "What License is BlockNote using? Can I use it for commercial projects?",
    answer: `BlockNote is licensed under the MPL 2.0 license, which allows you to use BlockNote in commercial (and closed-source) applications. 
    If you make changes to the BlockNote source files, you're expected to publish these changes so the wider community can benefit as well.`,
