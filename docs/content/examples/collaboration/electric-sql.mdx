title: Collaborative Editing with ElectricSQL
author: matthewlipski
---

In this example, we use ElectricSQL to let multiple users collaborate on a single BlockNote document in real-time. The setup for this demo is more involved than the other collaboration examples, as it requires a running server and has a more fully-fledged UI. Therefore, the demo just uses an iframe element to show a hosted instance of the full ElectricSQL + BlockNote setup, which you can find the code for [here](https://github.com/TypeCellOS/blocknote-electric-example).

**Try it out:** Open this page (or the [iframe url](https://blocknote-electric-example.vercel.app/)) in a new browser tab or window to see it in action!
