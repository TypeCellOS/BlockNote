# Styling & Theming

You can completely change the look and feel of the BlockNote editor. Change basic styling quickly with [theme CSS variables](/docs/react/styling-theming/themes), or apply more complex styles with [additional CSS rules](/docs/react/styling-theming/overriding-css).

If you want to change, remove, or entirely replace the React components for menus & toolbars, see [UI Components](/docs/react/styling-theming/components).
