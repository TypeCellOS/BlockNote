# Using BlockNote With React

BlockNote provides a powerful React integration that makes it easy to add rich text editing capabilities to your applications. The React bindings offer a declarative API that integrates seamlessly with React's component model and state management patterns.

## Key Components

The React integration centers around two main pieces:

- **`useCreateBlockNote`** - A React hook that creates and manages editor instances
- **`BlockNoteView`** - A component that renders the editor with a complete UI

## Quick Start

Here's a minimal example of how to integrate BlockNote into a React component:

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { useCreateBlockNote } from "@blocknote/react";
import { BlockNoteView } from "@blocknote/mantine";
// Or, you can use ariakit, shadcn, etc.

function MyEditor() {
  const editor = useCreateBlockNote();

  return <BlockNoteView editor={editor} />;
}
```

This gives you a fully functional editor with:

- Text editing and formatting
- Block types (paragraphs, headings, lists, etc.)
- Toolbar for formatting options
- Side menu for block operations

## BlockNoteView

The `<BlockNoteView>` component is used to render the editor. It also provides a number of props for editor specific events.

### Props

<auto-type-table
  path="../../../../packages/react/src/editor/BlockNoteView.tsx"
  name="BlockNoteViewProps"
/>

## Hooks

### useCreateBlockNote

The `useCreateBlockNote` hook is used to create a new `BlockNoteEditor` instance.

```tsx twoslash
import React from "react";
/**
 * The options for the editor, like initial content, schema, etc.
 * See the [Editor Options API reference](/docs/reference/editor/options) for more details
 */
type BlockNoteEditorOptions = object;
/**
 * See the [Editor API reference](/docs/reference/editor/manipulate-blocks) for more details
 */
type BlockNoteEditor = object;
/**
 * This hook creates a new editor instance, but doesn't render it.
 */
// ---cut---
declare function useCreateBlockNote(
  options?: BlockNoteEditorOptions,
  deps?: React.DependencyList,
): BlockNoteEditor;
```

### useEditorChange

The `useEditorChange` hook is used to listen for changes to the editor.

```tsx twoslash
import React from "react";
/**
 * The blocks that were inserted, updated, or deleted by the change that occurred.
 * See the [Events documentation](/docs/reference/editor/events#onchange) for more details
 */
type BlocksChanged = object;
/**
 * See the [Editor API reference](/docs/reference/editor/manipulate-blocks) for more details
 */
type BlockNoteEditor = object;
/**
 * This hook creates a new editor instance, but doesn't render it.
 */
// ---cut---
declare function useEditorChange(
  callback: (
    editor: BlockNoteEditor,
    ctx: {
      /**
       * Returns the blocks that were inserted, updated, or deleted by the change that occurred.
       */
      getChanges(): BlocksChanged;
    },
  ) => void,
  editor?: BlockNoteEditor,
): BlockNoteEditor;
```

### useEditorSelectionChange

The `useEditorSelectionChange` hook is used to listen for changes to the editor selection.

```tsx twoslash
import React from "react";
/**
 * See the [Editor API reference](/docs/reference/editor/manipulate-blocks) for more details
 */
type BlockNoteEditor = object;
/**
 * This hook listens for changes to the editor selection.
 */
// ---cut---
declare function useEditorSelectionChange(
  /**
   * Callback that runs when the editor's selection changes.
   */
  callback: () => void,
  editor?: BlockNoteEditor,
): BlockNoteEditor;
```

## Next Steps

Now that you have a basic editor working, you can explore:

- [Block Types](/docs/features/blocks) - Learn about different content blocks
- [Formatting](/docs/react/styling-theming) - Customize text and block formatting
- [Customization](/docs/features/custom-schemas/custom-blocks) - Build custom UI components
- [Examples](/examples) - See more advanced usage patterns

The editor is now ready to use! Start typing and explore the various block types and formatting options available in the toolbar.
