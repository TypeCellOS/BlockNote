# Editor Setup

You can customize your editor when you instantiate it. Let's take a closer looks at the basic methods and components to set up your BlockNote editor.

## Create an editor

Create a new `BlockNoteEditor` by calling the `useCreateBlockNote` hook. This instantiates a new editor and its required state. You can later interact with the editor using the Editor API and pass it to the `BlockNoteView` component.

```tsx twoslash
import React from "react";
/**
 * The options for the editor, like initial content, schema, etc.
 * See the [Editor Options API reference](/docs/reference/editor/overview#options) for more details
 */
type BlockNoteEditorOptions = object;
/**
 * See the [Editor API reference](/docs/reference/editor/manipulate-blocks) for more details
 */
type BlockNoteEditor = object;
/**
 * This hook creates a new editor instance, but doesn't render it.
 */
// ---cut---
declare function useCreateBlockNote(
  options?: BlockNoteEditorOptions,
  deps?: React.DependencyList,
): BlockNoteEditor;
```

The hook takes two optional parameters:

**options:** Configure the editor with options like (see [Editor Options](/docs/reference/editor/overview#options) for all options):

- `initialContent` - Set starting content
- `domAttributes` - Add HTML attributes to editor elements. See [Adding DOM Attributes](/docs/react/styling-theming/adding-dom-attributes) for more.
- `dictionary` - Customize text strings for localization. See the [Localization](/docs/features/localization) for more.
- `schema` - Add custom blocks and styles. See [Custom Schemas](/docs/features/custom-schemas).
- `tabBehavior` - Control tab key behavior (`"prefer-navigate-ui"` or `"prefer-indent"`)

**deps:** React dependency array that determines when to recreate the editor.

  <strong>Manually creating the editor (`BlockNoteEditor.create`)</strong>
  <p>
    The `useCreateBlockNote` hook is actually a simple `useMemo` wrapper around
    the `BlockNoteEditor.create` method. You can use this method directly if you
    want to control the editor lifecycle manually. For example, we do this in
    the [Saving & Loading example](/examples/backend/saving-loading) to delay
    the editor creation until some content has been fetched from an external
    data source.

## Render the editor

Use the `<BlockNoteView>` component to render the `BlockNoteEditor` instance you just created:

```tsx
const editor = useCreateBlockNote();

return <BlockNoteView editor={editor} />;
```

The `<BlockNoteView>` component has a number of props that you can use to customize the editor. See [React Overview](/docs/react/overview) for more information. But, here are some important props to consider:

- `editor`: The `BlockNoteEditor` instance to render.
- `editable`: Whether the editor should be editable.
- `onChange`: Callback fired when the editor content (document) changes.
- `onSelectionChange`: Callback fired when the editor selection changes.
- `theme`: The editor's theme, see [Themes](/docs/react/styling-theming/themes) for more about this.

  <strong>Uncontrolled component</strong>
  <p>
    Note that the `BlockNoteView` component is an [uncontrolled component](https://react.dev/learn/sharing-state-between-components#controlled-and-uncontrolled-components). 
    This means you don't pass in the editor content directly as a prop. You can use the `initialContent` option in the `useCreateBlockNote` hook to set the initial content of the editor (similar to the `defaultValue` prop in a regular React `<textarea>`).
  </p>
  <p>
    BlockNote handles the complexities and performance optimizations of managing editor state internally. You can interact with the editor content using the [Editor API](/docs/editor-api).
