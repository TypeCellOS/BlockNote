# Getting Started

Getting started with BlockNote is quick and easy. Install the required packages and add the React component to your app.

## Install

To install BlockNote with [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm), run:

```console tab="npm"
npm install @blocknote/core @blocknote/react @blocknote/mantine
```

```console tab="pnpm"
pnpm add @blocknote/core @blocknote/react @blocknote/mantine
```

```console tab="bun"
bun add @blocknote/core @blocknote/react @blocknote/mantine
```

BlockNote provides multiple UI library options. Choose the one that best fits your project:

- **[Mantine](/docs/getting-started/mantine)** (`@blocknote/mantine`) - Recommended for new projects
- **[Shadcn](/docs/getting-started/shadcn)** (`@blocknote/shadcn`)
- **[Ariakit](/docs/getting-started/ariakit)** (`@blocknote/ariakit`)

## Create an editor

The fastest way to get started with the BlockNote is by using the `useCreateBlockNote` hook and `BlockNoteView` component:

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { useCreateBlockNote } from "@blocknote/react";
// Or, you can use ariakit, shadcn, etc.
import { BlockNoteView } from "@blocknote/mantine";
// Default styles for the mantine editor
import "@blocknote/mantine/style.css";
// Include the included Inter font
import "@blocknote/core/fonts/inter.css";

export default function MyEditor() {
  // Create a new editor instance
  const editor = useCreateBlockNote();

  // Render the editor
  return <BlockNoteView editor={editor} />;
}
```

For more information about the `useCreateBlockNote` hook and the `BlockNoteView` component, see [React Overview](/docs/react/overview).

  Are you using Next.js (`create-next-app`)? Because BlockNote is a client-only
  component, make sure to disable server-side rendering of BlockNote. [Read our
  guide on setting up Next.js + BlockNote](/docs/getting-started/nextjs)

## Next steps

You now know how to integrate BlockNote into your React app! However, this is just scratching the surface of what you can do with BlockNote.

- Learn about [blocks and the editor basics](/docs/foundations/document-structure) and how to interact with the editor using the [editor API](/docs/reference/editor/manipulate-blocks)
- See [UI Components](/docs/react/styling-theming/components/) to customize built-in menus and toolbars and [Styling & Theming](/docs/react/styling-theming/) to customize the look and feel of the editor
- Further extend the editor with your own Blocks using [Custom Schemas](/docs/reference/editor/custom-schemas/) or add [Real-Time Collaboration](/docs/features/collaboration/)
