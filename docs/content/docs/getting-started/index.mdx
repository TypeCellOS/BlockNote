# Getting Started

Getting started with BlockNote is quick and easy. Install the required packages and add the React component to your app.

## Install

To install BlockNote with [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm), run:

```console tab="npm"
npm install @mantine/core @mantine/hooks @mantine/utils
npm install @blocknote/core @blocknote/react @blocknote/mantine
```

```console tab="pnpm"
pnpm add @mantine/core @mantine/hooks @mantine/utils
pnpm add @blocknote/core @blocknote/react @blocknote/mantine
```

```console tab="bun"
bun add @mantine/core @mantine/hooks @mantine/utils
bun add @blocknote/core @blocknote/react @blocknote/mantine
```

This will install the [Mantine UI](https://mantine.dev/) version of BlockNote, which works great out of the box and is recommended for new projects.

BlockNote also provides multiple alternative UI library options. Choose the one that best fits your needs:

- **[ShadCN](/docs/getting-started/shadcn)** (`@blocknote/shadcn`): Recommended for projects that already use ShadCN components or [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
- **[Ariakit](/docs/getting-started/ariakit)** (`@blocknote/ariakit`): Recommended for projects which require unstyled components for the editor.

## Create an editor

The fastest way to get started with the BlockNote is by using the `useCreateBlockNote` hook and `BlockNoteView` component:

<Example name="basic/minimal" />

For more information about the `useCreateBlockNote` hook and the `BlockNoteView` component, see [React Overview](/docs/react/overview).

  Are you using Next.js (`create-next-app`)? Because BlockNote is a client-only
  component, make sure to disable server-side rendering of BlockNote. [Read our
  guide on setting up Next.js + BlockNote](/docs/getting-started/nextjs)

## Usage in Mantine apps

In the demo above, the `@blocknote/mantine/style.css` stylesheet is imported to style the UI components. If your application already uses Mantine UI though, you should use the `@blocknote/mantine/blocknoteStyles.css` stylesheet instead. It only contains the styles added by BlockNote on top of the Mantine core styles, whereas `@blocknote/mantine/style.css` includes both.

## Next steps

You now know how to integrate BlockNote into your React app! However, this is just scratching the surface of what you can do with BlockNote.

- Learn about [blocks and the editor basics](/docs/foundations/document-structure) and how to interact with the editor using the [editor API](/docs/reference/editor/manipulating-content)
- See [UI Components](/docs/react/components) to customize built-in menus and toolbars and [Styling & Theming](/docs/react/styling-theming) to customize the look and feel of the editor
- Further extend the editor with your own Blocks using [Custom Schemas](/docs/features/custom-schemas) or add [Real-Time Collaboration](/docs/features/collaboration)
