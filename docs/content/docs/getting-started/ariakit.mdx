# Getting Started With Ariakit

[Ariakit](https://ariakit.org/) is an open-source library of unstyled (headless), primitive components with a focus on Accessibility. To use BlockNote with Ariakit, you can import `BlockNoteView` from `@blocknote/ariakit`

```console tab="npm"
npm install @blocknote/core @blocknote/react @blocknote/ariakit
```

```console tab="pnpm"
pnpm add @blocknote/core @blocknote/react @blocknote/ariakit
```

```console tab="bun"
bun add @blocknote/core @blocknote/react @blocknote/ariakit
```

You can fully style the components with your own CSS, or import the provided default styles using the CSS file from `@blocknote/ariakit/style.css`.
