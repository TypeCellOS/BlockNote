# Getting Started With Mantine

[Mantine](https://mantine.dev/) is an open-source collection of React components.

```console tab="npm"
npm install @blocknote/core @blocknote/react @blocknote/mantine
```

```console tab="pnpm"
pnpm add @blocknote/core @blocknote/react @blocknote/mantine
```

```console tab="bun"
bun add @blocknote/core @blocknote/react @blocknote/mantine
```

To use BlockNote with Mantine, you can import `BlockNoteView` from `@blocknote/mantine` and the stylesheet from `@blocknote/mantine/style.css`.

<Example name="basic/minimal" />

## Usage within a Mantine app

By default, the [`BlockNoteView`](/docs/getting-started/editor-setup#render-the-editor) component from `@blocknote/mantine` will be wrapped in a [`MantineProvider`](https://mantine.dev/theming/mantine-provider/) context. However, if you're already using Mantine for your application UI, this context will already be provided.

Therefore, `@blocknote/mantine` also includes a `BlockNoteViewNoProvider` component which expects to be rendered in an existing `MantineProvider` context and does not include its own. It takes the same props as the regular `BlockNoteView`.
