# Getting Started With Mantine

[Mantine](https://mantine.dev/) is an open-source collection of React components.

```console tab="npm"
npm install @blocknote/core @blocknote/react @blocknote/mantine
```

```console tab="pnpm"
pnpm add @blocknote/core @blocknote/react @blocknote/mantine
```

```console tab="bun"
bun add @blocknote/core @blocknote/react @blocknote/mantine
```

To use BlockNote with Mantine, you can import `BlockNoteView` from `@blocknote/mantine` and the stylesheet from `@blocknote/mantine/style.css`.
