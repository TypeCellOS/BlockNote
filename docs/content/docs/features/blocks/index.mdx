BlockNote supports a number of built-in blocks, inline content types, and styles that are included in the editor by default. This is called the Default Schema. To create your own content types, see [Custom Schemas](/docs/reference/editor/custom-schemas).

The demo below showcases each of BlockNote's built-in block and inline content types:

<Example name="basic/default-blocks" />

### Default Block Properties

There are some default block props that BlockNote uses for the built-in blocks:

```typescript twoslash
type DefaultProps = {
  /**
   * The background color of the block, which also applies to nested blocks.
   * @default "default"
   */
  backgroundColor: string;
  /**
   * The text color of the block, which also applies to nested blocks.
   * @default "default"
   */
  textColor: string;
  /**
   * The text alignment of the block.
   * @default "left"
   */
  textAlignment: "left" | "center" | "right" | "justify";
};
```
