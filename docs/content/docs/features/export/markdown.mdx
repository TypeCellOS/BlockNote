# Markdown Export

<Callout type={"warning"}>
    The functions to export to Markdown are considered "lossy"; some information might be dropped when you export Blocks to Markdown.

    To serialize Blocks to a non-lossy format (for example, to store the contents of the editor in your backend), simply export the built-in Block format using `JSON.stringify(editor.document)`.

</Callout>

BlockNote can export Blocks to Markdown. Note that this is also considered "lossy", as not all structures can be entirely represented in Markdown.

### Export Markdown

`blocksToMarkdownLossy` converts `Block` objects to a Markdown string:

```typescript
async blocksToMarkdownLossy(blocks?: Block[]): Promise<string>;

// Usage
const markdownFromBlocks = await editor.blocksToMarkdownLossy(blocks);
```

`blocks:` The blocks to convert. If not provided, the entire document (all top-level blocks) is used.

`returns:` The blocks, serialized as a Markdown string.

The output is simplified as Markdown does not support all features of BlockNote (e.g.: children of blocks which aren't list items are un-nested and certain styles are removed).
