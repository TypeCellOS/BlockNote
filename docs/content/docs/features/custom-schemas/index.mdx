# Custom Schemas

By default, BlockNote documents support different kind of blocks, inline content and text styles (see [default schema](/docs/foundations/schemas)).
However, you can extend BlockNote and create custom schemas to support your own blocks, inline content and text styles.

## Custom Blocks

Blocks are the main elements of a document, such as paragraphs, headings, lists, etc.

## Custom Inline Content

Inline Content are elements that can be inserted inside a text block, such as links, mentions, tags, etc.

## Custom Styles

Text Styles are properties that can be applied to a piece of text, such as bold, italic, underline, etc.

## Creating your own schema

Once you have defined your custom blocks (see the links above), inline content or styles, you can create a schema and pass this to the initialization of the editor.

```typescript
const schema = BlockNoteSchema.create({
  blockSpecs: {
    // enable the default blocks if desired
    ...defaultBlockSpecs,

    // Add your own custom blocks:
    // customBlock: CustomBlock,
  },
  inlineContentSpecs: {
    // enable the default inline content if desired
    ...defaultInlineContentSpecs,

    // Add your own custom inline content:
    // customInlineContent: CustomInlineContent,
  },
  styleSpecs: {
    // enable the default styles if desired
    ...defaultStyleSpecs,

    // Add your own custom styles:
    // customStyle: CustomStyle
  },
});
```

You can then pass this to the instantiation of your BlockNoteEditor (`BlockNoteEditor.create` or `useCreateBlockNote`):

```typescript
const editor = useCreateBlockNote({
  schema,
});
```

## Usage with TypeScript

In contrast to most other editors, BlockNote has been designed for full TypeScript compatibility. This means you can get full type safety and autocompletion _even when using a custom schema_.

By default, the methods, hooks, and types exposed by the API assume you're using the default, built-in schema. If you're using a custom schema, there are 3 ways to get full type safety:

### Methods that accept an optional `schema` parameter

Some methods, like the `useBlockNoteEditor` hook, take an optional `schema?: BlockNoteSchema` parameter. If you're using a custom schema, you should pass it here to make sure the return type is correctly typed.

### Manual typing of types

If you're using types like `BlockNoteEditor`, `Block`, `PartialBlock` directly, you can get the correctly typed variants like this:

```typescript
type MyBlock = Block<
  typeof schema.blockSchema,
  typeof schema.inlineContentSchema,
  typeof schema.styleSchema
>;
```

Or even simpler, use the shorthands exposed by the schema:

```typescript
type MyBlockNoteEditor = typeof schema.BlockNoteEditor;
type MyBlock = typeof schema.Block;
type MyPartialBlock = typeof schema.PartialBlock;
```

### Automatically override all default types (experimental)

Alternatively, the easiest way to get full type safety without any additional work is to override all default types with your custom schema, by using a custom type definition file. See this [example blocknote.d.ts](https://github.com/TypeCellOS/BlockNote/blob/main/examples/06-custom-schema/react-custom-styles/blocknote.d.ts.example). This is an experimental feature - we would love to hear your feedback on this approach.
