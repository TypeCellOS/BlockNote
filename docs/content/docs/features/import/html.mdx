# HTML Import

It's possible to import HTML content into BlockNote blocks, completely client-side.

<Callout type={"warning"}>
    The functions to import from HTML are considered "lossy"; some information might be dropped when converting HTML to Blocks.

    To serialize Blocks to a non-lossy format (for example, to store the contents of the editor in your backend), simply export the built-in Block format using `JSON.stringify(editor.document)`.

</Callout>

### HTML to Blocks

Use `tryParseHTMLToBlocks` to parse an HTML string to `Block` objects:

```typescript
async tryParseHTMLToBlocks(html: string): Promise<Blocks[]>;

// Usage
const blocksFromHTML = await editor.tryParseHTMLToBlocks(html);
```

`returns:` The blocks parsed from the HTML string.

Tries to create `Block` objects out of any HTML block-level elements, and `InlineContent` objects from any HTML inline elements, though not all HTML tags are recognized. If BlockNote doesn't recognize an element's tag, it will parse it as a paragraph or plain text.
