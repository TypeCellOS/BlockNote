# Markdown Import

<Callout type={"warning"}>
    The functions to import from Markdown are considered "lossy"; some information might be dropped when converting Markdown to Blocks.

    To serialize Blocks to a non-lossy format (for example, to store the contents of the editor in your backend), simply export the built-in Block format using `JSON.stringify(editor.document)`.

</Callout>

BlockNote can import Markdown content into Block objects. Note that this is considered "lossy", as not all Markdown structures can be entirely represented as BlockNote blocks.

## Markdown to Blocks

Use `tryParseMarkdownToBlocks` to try parsing a Markdown string into `Block` objects:

```typescript
async tryParseMarkdownToBlocks(markdown: string): Promise<Blocks[]>;

// Usage
const blocksFromMarkdown = await editor.tryParseMarkdownToBlocks(markdown);
```

`returns:` The blocks parsed from the Markdown string.

Tries to create `Block` and `InlineContent` objects based on Markdown syntax, though not all symbols are recognized. If BlockNote doesn't recognize a symbol, it will parse it as text.
