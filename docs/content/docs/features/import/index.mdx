- **HTML**: (Recommended) Import HTML content into BlockNote.
- **Markdown**: Import Markdown content into BlockNote.

## Migrating Between Editors

When switching editors, there are several migration strategies to consider:

- **Legacy Editor Approach**: Keep both the old and new editors running in parallel. Use the legacy editor for existing content while creating new content in BlockNote.
  - Minimizes disruption to your existing application
  - Can segment usage by content type, organization, or other criteria
- **Hard Cutoff**: Migrate all content at once on a specific date
  - Provides a clean break and fresh start
  - May require more upfront preparation
- **Gradual Migration**: Convert content progressively, such as when files are opened
  - Smoother transition with less immediate impact
  - Migration period may extend over a longer time

Choose the strategy that best fits your specific needs and constraints.

const existingContent = "<p>This is a paragraph.</p>";

const blocks = await editor.tryParseHTMLToBlocks(existingContent);

await storeToDB(blocks);
```
