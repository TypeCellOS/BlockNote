# BlockNote API Overview

The BlockNote editor API is a comprehensive set of functions and methods that allow you to interact with the editor and manipulate its content.

## Editable

The editor is editable by default, but you can make it read-only by setting the `editable` property to `false`.

```ts
editor.editable = false;
```

## Focus

To focus the editor, you can use the `focus` method.

```ts
editor.focus();
```

Check if the editor has focus.

```ts
const isFocused = editor.isFocused();
```

## Undo/Redo

To undo the last operation, you can use the `undo` method.

```ts
editor.undo();
```

To redo the last undone operation, you can use the `redo` method.

```ts
editor.redo();
```

## Events

To read more about events, see the [Events](/docs/reference/editor/events) reference.

## Document Manipulation

To read more about block manipulation, see the [Block Manipulation](/docs/reference/editor/manipulate-blocks) reference.
To read more about inline content manipulation, see the [Inline Content Manipulation](/docs/reference/editor/manipulating-inline-content) reference.

### Transactions

BlockNote supports transactions, which allow you to group multiple changes into a single operation. This is useful for a better user experience, since undo/redo of changes is much more natural.

```ts
// ✅ Good - This is a single undo/redo operation
editor.transact(() => {
  editor.insertBlocks([{ type: "paragraph", content: "Hello, world!" }], "abc");
  editor.replaceBlocks([{ id: "123" }], {
    type: "paragraph",
    content: "Hello, world!",
  });
});

// ❌ Avoid - This is two separate undo/redo operations
editor.insertBlocks([{ type: "paragraph", content: "Hello, world!" }], "abc");
editor.replaceBlocks([{ id: "123" }], {
  type: "paragraph",
  content: "Hello, world!",
});
```

## Cursor & Selections

To read more about cursor and selection manipulation, see the [Cursor & Selections](/docs/reference/editor/cursor-selections) reference.

## Paste Operations

### Paste HTML

Paste HTML content into the editor.

```ts
// Paste and convert to BlockNote format (default)
editor.pasteHTML("<p>Hello, world!</p>");

// Paste as raw HTML
editor.pasteHTML("<p>Hello, world!</p>", true);
```

### Paste Text

Paste text content into the editor.

```ts
editor.pasteText("Hello, world!");
```

### Paste Markdown

Paste Markdown content into the editor.

```ts
await editor.pasteMarkdown("# Hello\n\nThis is **bold** text.");
```

## Options

The editor can be configured with the following options when using `BlockNoteEditor.create`:

<auto-type-table
  path="../../../../../packages/core/src/editor/BlockNoteEditor.ts"
  name="BlockNoteEditorOptions"
/>
