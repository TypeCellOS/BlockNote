# Schemas

Schemas are the core of how BlockNote works. They are the basic building blocks of the editor, and are used to define the content of the editor.

The schema is a collection of definitions for the different types of blocks, inline content, and styles that can be used in the editor.

By default, BlockNote contains everything found under the [Built-in Blocks](/docs/features/blocks) section. You can also modify this default schema, or create your own from scratch - see [Custom Schemas](/docs/features/custom-schemas) to learn how.
