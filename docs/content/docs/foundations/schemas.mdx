# Schemas

Schemas are the core of how BlockNote works. They are the basic building blocks of the editor, and are used to define the content of the editor.

The schema is a collection of definitions for the different types of blocks, inline content, and styles that can be used in the editor.

<Callout type="info">
  If you are using the default blocks, inline content, and styles, you do not
  need to specify a schema, since we use the default which uses the default
  blocks, inline content, and styles.
</Callout>

## Creating a Schema

You can create a schema using the `BlockNoteSchema.create` function.

```tsx
import {
  BlockNoteSchema,
  defaultBlockSpecs,
  defaultInlineContentSpecs,
  defaultStyleSpecs,
} from "@blocknote/core";

const schema = BlockNoteSchema.create({
  blockSpecs: {
    // Adds all default blocks.
    ...defaultBlockSpecs,
    // Adds the Alert block.
    alert: Alert,
  },
  // This is already the default, but you can add more inline content types here.
  inlineContentSpecs: defaultInlineContentSpecs,
  // This is already the default, but you can add more style types here.
  styleSpecs: defaultStyleSpecs,
});
```

## Using a Schema

You can use a schema by passing it to the `useCreateBlockNote` hook.

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { useCreateBlockNote } from "@blocknote/react";
import { BlockNoteSchema } from "@blocknote/core";
import { BlockNoteView } from "@blocknote/mantine";

const schema = BlockNoteSchema.create();

function Editor() {
  const editor = useCreateBlockNote({
    schema,
  });

  return <BlockNoteView editor={editor} />;
}
```
