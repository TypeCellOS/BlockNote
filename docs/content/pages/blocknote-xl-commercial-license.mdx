## 2. The license

### 2.1. Choice of license

Licensor offers the XL Packages under a dual license model. Licensor offers two licensing options:

- a) the open source GPL, where any modifications or derivative works must also be made available under the license terms of GPL; and
- b) this Commercial License, where you may use the Software under the terms and conditions mentioned in this Agreement.

This Agreement is only applicable if you use the Commercial License.

### 2.2. Evaluation (trial) license

You are free to try the Software:

- a) for a limited period of 30 days starting from the first use of the Software in a non-production environment; and
- b) for the development of code not intended for production (for example, the reproduction of a bug in a GitHub issue, doing a performance benchmark).

After the given trial period, you must license the Software if you continue to use it, whether in a production environment or non-production environment.

### 2.3. Startup license

Companies with fewer than five employees are eligible to use the Commercial License against a discount, subject to written confirmation. Please contact the Licensor if you believe you might be eligible for the discount.

If, at any time during the License Term, the Licensee or its Affiliates employ five (5) or more individuals, the Licensee must promptly notify the Licensor and the Startup License shall automatically convert into a standard Commercial License at the full applicable license fee for the remainder of the License Term. The difference between the discounted fee and the full fee will become due upon conversion.

Failure to report a change in entitlement of the startup license may result, at Licensor’s discretion, in termination of the Commercial License and this Agreement or in the invoicing of the discount granted for the period during which Licensee no longer met the entitlement conditions as mentioned in this article.

### 2.4. Commercial License grant

In exchange for the fee due under section 6 (Payment), or as otherwise agreed, Licensor hereby grants Licensee and Affiliates a Commercial License to install and use the Software.

The Commercial License granted to Licensee and its Affiliates allows a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable, sublicensable, royalty-free license, commencing on the Effective Date.

The Commercial License entitles the Licensee to use the Software in development on a **single** Application and for deployment in a single Production Environment, subject to the License Term and other conditions of this Agreement. Continued use of the Software in any deployed Application requires an active Commercial License, even if no development activity occurs after deployment.

The Commercial License allows the use of the latest version and all older versions released. Access to software updates is governed by section 7 (Updates).

### 2.5. Usage rights

Licensee may include the Software in a larger work containing more than the Software and may give limited usage rights (a sublicense) to Users as part of that larger work. The person or organization that receives this sublicense is the sublicensee. The sublicensee is allowed to use the Software only under the same conditions as the Licensee. However, the sublicensee shall not have the right to sublicense its rights.

Licensee shall ensure (and shall procure that its Affiliates shall ensure) that the terms of any sublicense are in writing and are substantially the same and as restrictive as the terms of this Agreement.

### 2.6. Restrictions

Licensee shall not:

- a) sell, rent, lease, distribute, assign, transfer, or encumber rights to the Software;
- b) allow access to the Software by others not licensed under this Agreement;
- c) share modified copies of the Software or documentation with others not licensed under this Agreement;
- d) include any portion of the Software in any project that directly or indirectly competes with the Software. Directly competing means in any case developing a text editor framework or library for third party developers;
- e) use the Commercial License for more than one Project as mentioned in section 2.4 (Commercial License grant)
- f) use more than the permitted amount of seats as mentioned in section 2.7 (Required quantity of licenses); and
- g) assist or allow others to use the Software against the terms of this Agreement.

If the Licensor has any reasonable ground to believe that the Licensee violates this section 2.6 the Licensor may terminate the Commercial License directly and exclude the Licensee from any further use of the Software. In that case, the Licensor is not obliged to (re)pay any amounts already collected or any compensation.

### 2.7. Required quantity of licenses for development

A single Commercial License permits **five** Licensed Developers(seats) to use the Software in a single Application for development.

The number of seats required corresponds to the maximum number of concurrent Licensed Developers (in any continuous 7-day period) contributing changes to the Front-end code of the projects that use the Software. Concurrent means development work carried out during the same calendar week, regardless of time zone.

If the Licensee has not purchased a sufficient amount of Commercial Licenses, the Licensee must purchase the additional Commercial Licenses required to comply with this Agreement. The Licensor will determine the price, which may be up to the full original listed price at the Site.

{/*

### 2.8. Exemptions from Commercial License

No Commercial License is required if:

- a) you are an open source contributor who is not affiliated with the Licensee; or
- b) you are someone who solely executes the front end for testing purposes, such as verifying back-end changes, and are not contributing changes to the Front-end code.

Licensor is committed to supporting Open Source Software (OSS). When Licensee is developing OSS licensed under an Open Source Initiative approved license and not compatible with the GPL (e.g. a permissive license like MIT), Licensee may include the Software in its project and use the Commercial License free of charge, provided that:

- a) the Software is used solely for the development or demonstration of your open source project;
- b) Licensee informs its downstream users that enabling any feature relying on our Software will require compliance with either the GPL or the Commercial License.

For clarity, inclusion of the Software in your OSS project, where it is completely disabled and not exposed to Users, does not trigger GPL reciprocity or the terms of this Commercial License until such functionality is enabled or made accessible.

Please contact the Licensor for explicit permission or clarification if you intend to enable the Software in a publicly accessible or hosted environment, or if you are uncertain whether your use qualifies under these conditions.
*/}

### 2.8. Third party

Licensee may allow its agents, contractors, and outsourcing service providers (each a **Permitted Third Party**) to use the Software licensed to Licensee hereunder solely for Licensee's benefit in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and Licensee is responsible for any such Permitted Third Party's compliance with this Agreement in such use. Any breach by any Permitted Third Party of the terms of this Agreement will be considered a breach by the Licensee.

## 3. Term

### 3.1. Monthly License

The Licensor offers a Monthly license outside of production and in production.

At the end of each License Term, the Commercial License will be automatically renewed always for the period of one month. Licensee can cancel the Commercial License before the end of a License Term by sending an email to team@blocknotejs.org. In case of timely cancellation the License Term will not be automatically renewed.

### 3.2. Perpetual license

Perpetual licenses are not offered as part of the standard license plans but may be available under custom licensing terms upon request.

## 4. Source code

4.1. Licensor shall make the Software available in source code form to Licensee. The source code is currently publicly available at https://github.com/typecellOS/blocknote.

4.2. Licensee and its Affiliates shall be permitted to create modifications to the source code of the Software for Licensee's (and its Affiliates') use in accordance with this Agreement

4.3. In the event that Licensee and/or its Affiliates create any modifications to the source code of the Software, Licensor shall not be obliged to provide support services in relation to any such modification(s). The warranty doesn't cover any such modification(s).

## 5. Termination

### 5.1. Termination for breach

Either party may terminate this Agreement by giving the other written notice if:

- a) the other party materially breaches any term of this Agreement and it is not possible to remedy that breach;
- b) the other party materially breaches any term of this Agreement and it is possible to remedy that breach, but the other party fails to do so within 30 days of this being requested in writing;
- c) the other party suffers or undergoes an insolvency event or a bankruptcy event or debtor's relief proceeding or ceases to do business.
- d) the other party is delayed in performing its obligations under this Agreement for a period of 30 days or more.

For the purposes of this clause, in order for it to be possible to remedy a breach, it must be possible to take steps so as to put the other party into the same position which (save as to the date) it would have been in if the breach had never occurred.

Upon termination of this Agreement, Licensee's license to access and use the Software will terminate. Licensee must immediately cease all the use of the Software, including deployment in Production Environments, and destroy all copies of the Software in its possession (and require any permitted third parties to do the same), unless Licensee has obtained a separate license pursuant to written agreement with Licensor.

### 5.4. Termination survival

Any provisions of this Agreement containing licensing restrictions, warranties and warranty disclaimers, confidentiality obligations, limitations of liability and/or indemnity terms, and any term of this Agreement which, by its nature, is intended to survive termination or expiration, will remain in effect following any termination or expiration of this Agreement, as will Licensee's obligation to pay any fees accrued and owing to Licensor as of termination or expiration.

### 5.5. Transition from Commercial License to GPL

If the Licensee chooses to discontinue the Commercial License and instead rely solely on the GPL license, all rights and benefits granted under the Commercial License shall immediately terminate. This includes, but is not limited to, access to the Software, priority updates, and any form of technical support or assistance provided under the Commercial License.

By transitioning to the GPL license, the Licensee agrees to comply fully with the terms of the GPL. The Licensor shall bear no further obligations toward the Licensee after the transition, and no refunds or credits shall be issued for any remaining term of the Commercial License.

Unless the currency is expressly provided, all amounts are in United States Dollars.

### 6.3. Taxes

### 9.3. Logic integrity

Licensor warrants that the Software shall not knowingly include: malware, viruses, trap doors, back doors, or other means or functions which will detrimentally interfere with or otherwise adversely affect Licensee's use of the Software or which will damage or destroy data or other property of Licensee.

### 9.4. Compliance with documentation

Licensor warrants to Licensee that, for twelve (12) months after the Effective Date, the Software shall perform substantially in accordance with the documentation. Licensee's exclusive remedy, and Licensor's sole liability, with respect to any breach of this warranty, will be for Licensor to use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly correct the non-compliance (provided that Licensee notifies Licensor in writing within the warranty period and allow Licensor a reasonable cure period). If Licensor, at its discretion, reasonably determines that such correction is not economically or technically feasible, Licensor may revoke Licensee's Commercial License grant and provide Licensee with a full refund of the fee paid to Licensor.

The Licensor provides no warranty, however, for unstable features of the Software. A feature is considered unstable if exposed to Licensee:

- a) through an API that includes "unstable" in its name;

Licensor shall notify Licensee in writing promptly upon notice of such claim and cooperates fully in the defense of such claim.
