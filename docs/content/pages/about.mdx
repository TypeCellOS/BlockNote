# About BlockNote

BlockNote is an open source, modular rich-text editor designed for developers building modern web applications. With a focus on an easy developer experience and a modern, block-based user experience, BlockNote powers the text editing experience behind knowledge bases, note-taking apps, document editors, and internal tools.

Our goal is to make it easy for developers to add a next-generation text editing experience to their app, with a UX that's on-par with industry leaders like Notion, Google Docs or Coda.

BlockNote is developed by a team of engineers — led by Matthew Lipski, Nick Perez, and Yousef El-Dardiry — with deep expertise in rich text editing and real-time collaborative software. The project is made possible through the support of our partners, sponsors and open-source community.
