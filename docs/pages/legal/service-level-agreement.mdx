# Service Level Agreement for Technical Support

This Service Level Agreement ("SLA") is entered into by and between OpenBlocks B.V. ("BlockNote"), hereinafter also referred to as "Licensor," and Licensee, hereinafter referred to as "Licensee," effective as of the Effective Date.

This SLA outlines the terms and conditions governing the provision of technical support services by the Licensor for the Software used by the Licensee. The objective of this SLA is to ensure that the Licensee receives timely and effective technical support for any issues arising in relation to the Software.

This SLA defines the terms of the support included with, or purchased additionally to the BlockNote Commercial License.

## 1. Definitions

Same as in [BlockNote Commercial License](/legal/blocknote-xl-commercial-license).

## 2. Support plans

### 2.1. Standard Support

BlockNote will provide the following services:

- Prioritization of issues raised by the Licensee's team over those from community users
- Direct access to the technical support team through GitHub and email

### 2.2. Priority Support

BlockNote will provide the following services:

- 48-hour first-response time for reported issues
- Prioritization of issues flagged by the Licensee's team over the "Standard Support" plan
- Direct access to the technical support team through GitHub, email, and a dedicated Slack channel

## 3. Support limitations

### 3.1. Fair use

While there is no hard limit on the number of support requests, BlockNote reserves the right to define and enforce a fair usage policy for the services provided under this SLA. The fair usage policy may include limits on the number of support requests, the scope of services, or other factors.

Support does not include the development of significant new features. If your team needs assistance with building new functionality or extensive help with integrating BlockNote, our team is available for hire through the Enterprise Plan. Please [contact us](/about) for more details.

### 3.2. General limitations

BlockNote shall not be responsible for providing support for any issues arising from:

- Modifications to the Software made by the Licensee without Licensor's written consent.
- Use of the Software in conjunction with third-party software or hardware not supported by the Software.
- Any failure or delay resulting from the Licensee's own network, hardware, or software.
- Product training or guidance beyond an acceptable level, as determined by BlockNote.

## 4. Service levels

### 4.1. First-response time

This first-response time begins when the Licensee completes the submission of a support ticket through BlockNote’s designated support channels. BlockNote guarantees the first-response time for all issues reported by the Licensee.

### 4.2. Working hours

BlockNote’s working hours are Monday through Friday, excluding weekends and holidays:

- New Year's Day (January 1st)
- Good Friday (date varies; Friday before Easter Sunday)
- Easter Monday (date varies; Monday following Easter Sunday)
- International Workers' Day (May 1st)
- Christmas Day and Boxing day (December 25th and 26th)

Please note that the observance of these holidays may vary by country, and additional holidays may be observed in specific regions or countries. If the Licensee submits a support ticket outside of BlockNote’s working hours, the First-response time will be calculated based on the remaining working hours and will resume at the start of the next working day.

### 4.3. Identification and prioritization of bug fixes

BlockNote will treat issues flagged by the Licensee as higher priority than issues for lower support plans. Upon bug identification, BlockNote will work with the Licensee to determine the following information:

- a) A description of the bug;
- b) An estimated timeline for the completion of the bug fix; and
- c) Any known workarounds or temporary solutions available to the Licensee.

Please note that the First-response does not necessarily include the information above, which will be determined separately as part of BlockNote’s collaboration with the Licensee.

The estimated time for resolution is provided as a reference for planning purposes only, and is not a strict deadline. BlockNote will communicate to the Licensee any changes to the estimated timeline as soon as possible.

### 4.4. Delivery of bug fixes and improvements

All bug fixes are delivered in the latest version and are not backported.

## 5. Support channels

The Licensee may submit support requests and report bugs through the following channels:

### 5.1. Email

Submit support requests by emailing the team directly at team@blocknotejs.org.

### 5.2. Slack

Clients with a Priority Support plan can establish a direct line of communication with the BlockNote team via Slack Connect.

### 5.3. GitHub

Issues can be reported by opening a ticket at: https://github.com/TypeCellOS/BlockNote/issues/new/choose. For faster response times under your support plan, please share a link to the GitHub issue through email or Slack after submission.

## 6. Review and amendments

This SLA will be reviewed annually, or more frequently if required, to ensure that it continues to meet the needs of both parties. Any amendments to this SLA must be mutually agreed upon in writing by both BlockNote and the Licensee.

## 7. Term and termination

This SLA shall remain in effect for the duration of the License Term between BlockNote and the Licensee, unless terminated earlier by either party in accordance with the terms of their underlying agreement.
