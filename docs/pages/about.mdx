One of our sponsors is the renowned NLNet foundation who are on a mission to support an open internet, and protect the privacy and security of internet users. [Check them out](https://www.nlnet.nl).

BlockNote is built on top of [ProseMirror](https://prosemirror.net/) - another great project worth supporting.
