## Subscriptions & Pro Features

Several individuals and organizations are sponsoring our work. If you're using BlockNote, the easiest way to support the project is by subscribing to BlockNote Pro. Subscribing also gets you **priority support** from the core team.

Subscribing to BlockNote Pro lets you access code for pro examples and get additional support from the BlockNote team. Find out more about BlockNote Pro subscriptions on the [pricing page](/pricing).

One of our sponsors is the renowned NLNet foundation who are on a mission to support an open internet, and protect the privacy and security of internet users. [Check them out](https://www.nlnet.nl).

BlockNote is built on top of [ProseMirror](https://prosemirror.net/) - another great project worth supporting.

Another great way to contribute is by becoming a Community member on Discord, help answering community questions and contribute to the codebase and documentation on GitHub.
