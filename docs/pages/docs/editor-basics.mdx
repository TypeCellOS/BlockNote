# Editor basics

In this section, we first explore the [methods to setup your editor](/docs/editor-basics/setup).
Then, we'll dive into the structure of documents, Blocks and rich text content in BlockNote ([document structure](/docs/editor-basics/document-structure)).
We'll also go over the blocks and content types that are part of BlockNote's [default built-in schema](/docs/editor-basics/default-schema).
