# Slash Menu

The Slash Menu is the list of commands which shows up whenever you type the "/" (slash) character, or when you click the "+" button in the [Side Menu](/docs/side-menu):

<img style={{maxWidth: "400px"}} src="/img/screenshots/slash_menu.png" alt="image" />

## Custom Slash Menu Item List

If you want to change the items that appear in the Slash Menu, you can do that using the `slashMenuItems` [editor option](/docs/editor#editor-options).

You can see how this is done in the example below, which has a custom Slash Menu item list. It includes all the default Slash Menu items, as well as a custom item, which inserts a new block below with "Hello World" in bold.

To find out how to get the default Slash Menu items, as well as how to make custom items, read on to [Slash Menu Items](/docs/slash-menu#slash-menu-items)

## Slash Menu Items

### Default Items

BlockNote comes with a variety of built-in Slash Menu items, which are used to change the type of the block containing the text cursor. If you don't pass anything to `slashMenuItems`, BlockNote will use these to set the Slash Menu contents.

If you want to change, remove & reorder the default items , you first import and copy them to a new array. From there, you can edit the array how you like, then pass it to `useBlockNote`:

```typescript jsx
import {
  BlockNoteView,
  getDefaultReactSlashMenuItems,
  useBlockNote
} from "@blocknote/react";
import "@blocknote/react/style.css";

function App() {
  const newSlashMenuItems = getDefaultReactSlashMenuItems();

  // Edit newSlashMenuItems
  ...

  const editor = useBlockNote({ slashMenuItems: newSlashMenuItems });

  return <BlockNoteView editor={editor} />;
}
```

### Custom Items

Creating a custom Slash Menu item is easy! Just declare a plain JavaScript object with the following fields:

```typescript
type SlashMenuItem = {
  name: string;
  execute: (editor: BlockNoteEditor) => void;
  aliases?: string[];
  group: string;
  icon: JSX.Element;
  hint?: string;
  shortcut?: string;
};
```

`name:` The item's name, which is the same string you see displayed in the menu, e.g. "Heading" or "Paragraph".

`execute:` A function that runs when the item is selected.

`aliases:` Other names for the item, used as shortcuts for search.

`group:` The name of the group the item belongs to, e.g. "Headings" or "Basic Blocks".

`icon:` The item's icon.

`hint:` A short phrase to describe what the item is for, which is displayed below its name.

`shortcuts:` A keyboard shortcut which can be used to run the item's `execute` function without the Slash Menu being open.
