# Block Side Menu

The Block Side Menu appears on the left side whenever you hover a block. By default, it consists of a `+` button and a drag handle (`⠿`):

<ThemedImage
  src="/img/screenshots/side_menu.png"
  darkImage="/img/screenshots/side_menu_dark.png"
  alt="image"
  width={500}
  height={500}
/>

Clicking the drag handle (`⠿`) in the Block Side Menu opens the Drag Handle Menu:

<ThemedImage
  src="/img/screenshots/drag_handle_menu.png"
  darkImage="/img/screenshots/drag_handle_menu_dark.png"
  alt="image"
  width={250}
  height={250}
/>

## Changing the Block Side Menu

You can change or replace the Block Side Menu with your own React component. In the demo below, the button to add a new block is replaced with one to remove the hovered block.

<Example name="ui-components/side-menu-buttons" />

We first define our custom `RemoveBlockButton`. The `useComponentsContext` hook gets all components used internally by BlockNote, so we want to use `Components.SideMenu.Button` for this.

We use the `SideMenu` component to create a custom Block Side Menu. By specifying its children, we can replace the default buttons in the menu with our own.

This custom Side Menu is passed to a `SideMenuController`, which controls its position and visibility (on the left side when you hover a block).

Setting `sideMenu={false}` on `BlockNoteView` tells BlockNote not to show the default Block Side Menu.

## Changing Drag Handle Menu Items

You can also change the items in the Drag Handle Menu. The demo below adds an item that resets the block type to a paragraph.

<Example name="ui-components/side-menu-drag-handle-items" />

Here, we use the `SideMenu` component but keep the default buttons (we don't pass any children). Instead, we pass our customized Drag Handle Menu using the `dragHandleMenu` prop.
