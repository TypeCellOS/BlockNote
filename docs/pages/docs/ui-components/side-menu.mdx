# Block Side Menu

The Block Side Menu appears whenever you hover over a block, and is used to drag & drop the block as well as add new ones below it.

You can also click the drag handle (`⠿`) in the Block Side Menu to open the Drag Handle Menu.

## Custom Side Menu

If you want to change the items in the Side Menu, or replace it altogether, you can do that using a React component.

You can see how this is done in the example below, which has a custom Side Menu with two items. The first one deletes the selected block, while the second one is a drag handle, which opens a menu on click.

<Example name="ui-components/side-menu-buttons" />

`CustomDragHandleMenu` is the component we use to replace the default Side Menu. You can see it's made up of a bunch of other components that are exported by BlockNote. Read on to [Components](/docs/side-menu#components) to find out more about these.

After creating `CustomDragHandleMenu`, we tell BlockNote to use it inside `BlockNoteView`. [Changing UI Elements](/docs/ui-elements) has more information about how this is done.

## Custom Drag Handle Menu

If you want to change the items in the Drag Handle Menu, or replace it altogether, you can do that using a React component.

You can see how this is done in the example below, which has a custom Drag Handle Menu. It contains the default items, as well as a custom item which opens an alert.

<Example name="ui-components/side-menu-drag-handle-items" />

`CustomDragHandleMenu` is the component we use to replace the default Drag Handle Menu. You can see it's made up of a bunch of other components that are exported by BlockNote. Read on to [Components](/docs/side-menu#components) to find out more about these.

Here, we're passing it as a prop to the `DefaultSideMenu` component, but you can also pass it to the `DragHandle` component we saw in the [previous demo](/docs/side-menu#custom-side-menu), if you don't want to use the default Side Menu layout.

After creating `CustomDragHandleMenu`, we tell BlockNote to use it inside `BlockNoteView`. [Changing UI Elements](/docs/ui-elements) has more information about how this is done.

## Components

BlockNote provides React components that you can reuse, to easily create your menus while matching the default styling.

### Default Components

BlockNote exports all components used to create the default layout - both the menu itself and the items in it. Head to the [default Side Menu's source code](https://github.com/TypeCellOS/BlockNote/blob/main/packages/react/src/SideMenu/components/DefaultSideMenu.tsx) and [default Drag Handle Menu's source code](https://github.com/TypeCellOS/BlockNote/blob/main/packages/react/src/SideMenu/components/DragHandleMenu/DefaultDragHandleMenu.tsx) to see all the components that you can use.

### Custom Components

BlockNote also provides components that you can use to make your own menu items, which also match the default styling:

```typescript
type SideMenuButtonProps = {
  children: JSX.Element;
}
export const SideMenuButton = (props: SideMenuButtonProps) => ...;

// Contains all props that a regular button element would take, as well as all props from the Mantine `Menu.Item` component.
type DragHandleMenuItemProps = PolymorphicComponentProps<"button"> & MenuItemProps
export const DragHandleMenuItem = (props: DragHandleMenuItemProps) => ...;
```
