# Formatting Toolbar

The Formatting Toolbar appears whenever you highlight text in the editor.

<ThemedImage
  src="/img/screenshots/formatting_toolbar.png"
  darkImage="/img/screenshots/formatting_toolbar_dark.png"
  alt="image"
  width={600}
  height={600}
/>

## Changing the Formatting Toolbar

You can change or replace the Formatting Toolbar with your own React component. In the demo below, 2 buttons are added to the default Formatting Toolbar - one to add a blue text/background, and one to toggle code styles.

<Example name="ui-components/formatting-toolbar-buttons" />

We first define our custom `BlueButton`. The `useComponentsContext` hook gets all components used internally by BlockNote, so we want to use `Components.FormattingToolbar.Button` for this.

We use the `FormattingToolbar` component to create a custom Formatting Toolbar. By specifying its children, we can replace the default buttons in the toolbar with our own.

This custom Formatting Toolbar is passed to a `FormattingToolbarController`, which controls its position and visibility (above or below the highlighted text).

Setting `formattingToolbar={false}` on `BlockNoteView` tells BlockNote not to show the default Formatting Toolbar.

## Changing Block Type Select (Dropdown) Items

The first element in the default Formatting Toolbar is the Block Type Select, and you can change the items in it. The demo makes the Block Type Select work for image blocks by adding an item to it.

<Example name="ui-components/formatting-toolbar-block-type-items" />

Here, we use the `FormattingToolbar` component but keep the default buttons (we don't pass any children). Instead, we pass our customized Block Type Select items using the `blockTypeSelectItems` prop.
