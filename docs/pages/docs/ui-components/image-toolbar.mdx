# Image Toolbar

The Image Toolbar appears whenever you select an image that doesn't have a URL, or when you click the "Replace Image" button in the [Formatting Toolbar](/docs/formatting-toolbar) when an image is selected.

<ThemedImage
  src="/img/screenshots/image_toolbar.png"
  darkImage="/img/screenshots/image_toolbar_dark.png"
  alt="image"
  width={600}
  height={600}
/>

## Image Upload

You may notice that upon creating a new BlockNote editor, the "Upload" tab in the Image Toolbar is missing. This is because you must provide BlockNote with a function to handle file uploads using the `uploadFile` [Editor Option](/docs/editor):

```ts
type uploadFile = (file: File) => Promise<string>;
```

`file:` The file to upload, in this case an image.

`returns:` A `Promise`, which resolves to the URL that the image can be accessed at.

You can use the provided `uploadToTempFilesOrg` function to as a starting point, which uploads files to [tmpfiles.org](https://tmpfiles.org/). However, it's not recommended to use this in a production environment - you should use your own backend:

<Example name="backend/file-uploading" />
