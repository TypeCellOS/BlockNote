# Suggestion Menus

Suggestion Menus appear when the user enters a trigger character, and text after the character is used to filter the menu items.

## Slash Menu

The Slash Menu is a Suggestion Menu that opens with the `/` character (or when clicking the `+` button in the [Block Side Menu](/docs/ui-components/side-menu).

### Changing Slash Menu Items

You can change the items in the Slash Menu. The demo below adds an item that inserts a new block, with "Hello World" in bold.

<Example name="ui-components/suggestion-menus-slash-menu-items" />

Passing `slashMenu={false}` to `BlockNoteView` tells BlockNote not to show the default Slash Menu. Adding the `SuggestionMenuController` with `triggerCharacter={"/"}` and a custom `getItems` function tells BlockNote to show one with custom items instead.

`getItems` should return the items that need to be shown in the Slash Menu, based on a `query` entered by the user (anything the user types after the `triggerCharacter`).

### Replacing the Slash Menu Component

You can replace the React component used for the Slash Menu with your own, as you can see in the demo below.

<Example name="ui-components/suggestion-menus-slash-menu-component" />

Again, we add a `SuggestionMenuController` component with `triggerCharacter={"/"}` and set `slashMenu={false}` to replace the default Slash Menu.

Now, we also pass a component to its `suggestionMenuComponent` prop. The `suggestionMenuComponent` we pass is responsible for rendering the filtered items. The `SuggestionMenuController` controls its position and visibility (below the trigger character), and it also determines which items should be shown (using the optional `getItems` prop we've seen above).

## Emoji Picker

The Emoji Picker is a Suggestion Menu that opens with the `:` character (or when selecting emoji item in the Slash Menu).

  style={{ maxWidth: "400px" }}
  src="/img/screenshots/emoji_picker.png"
  alt="image"
/>

### Changing Emoji Picker Columns

By default, the Emoji Picker is rendered with 10 columns, but you can change this to any amount. In the demo below, the Emoji Picker is changed to only display 5 columns.

<Example name="ui-components/suggestion-menus-emoji-picker-columns" />

Passing `emojiPicker={false}` to `BlockNoteView` tells BlockNote not to show the default Emoji Picker. Adding the `SuggestionMenuController` with `triggerCharacter={":"}` and `columns={5}` tells BlockNote to show one with 5 columns instead.

### Replacing the Emoji Picker Component

You can replace the React component used for the Emoji Picker with your own, as you can see in the demo below.

<Example name="ui-components/suggestion-menus-emoji-picker-component" />

Again, we add a `SuggestionMenuController` component with `triggerCharacter={":"}` and set `slashMenu={false}` to replace the default Slash Menu. We also set the `columns` prop so the `SuggestionMenuController` knows to render a grid.

Now, we also pass a component to its `suggestionMenuComponent` prop. The `suggestionMenuComponent` we pass is responsible for rendering the filtered items. The `SuggestionMenuController` controls its position and visibility (below the trigger character), and it also determines which items should be shown. Since we don't specify which items to show (the `getItems` prop isn't defined), it will use the default items for a grid, which are the emojis.

## Creating additional Suggestion Menus

You can add additional Suggestion Menus to the editor, which can use any trigger character. The demo below adds an example Suggestion Menu for mentions, which opens with the `@` character.

<Example name="custom-schema/suggestion-menus-mentions" />

Changing the items in the new Suggestion Menu, or the component used to render it, is done the same way as for the [Slash Menu](/docs/ui-components/suggestion-menus#slash-menu). For more information about how the mentions elements work, see [Custom Inline Content](/docs/custom-schemas/custom-inline-content).

### Grid Suggestion Menus

You may have noticed that the Emoji Picker is rendered using a grid instead of a stack. You can make your custom Suggestion Menus also render as a grid by passing a number to the `columns` prop in `SuggestionMenuController`. The demo below also adds a Suggestion Menu for mentions, but as a grid with only the first letters of names.

<Example name="ui-components/suggestion-menus-grid-mentions" />

Keep in mind that while we used the `DefaultReactSuggestionMenuItem` type in previous demos where we were setting the `getItems` prop, we're now using `DefaultReactGridSuggestionMenuItem`.

## Opening Suggestion Menus Programmatically

While suggestion menus are generally meant to be opened when the user presses a trigger character, you may also want to open them from code. To do this, you can use the following editor method:

```typescript
openSuggestionMenu(triggerCharacter: string): void;

// Usage
editor.openSuggestionMenu("/");
```
