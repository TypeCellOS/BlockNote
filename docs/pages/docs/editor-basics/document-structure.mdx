# Document Structure

Learn how documents (the content of the rich text editor) are structured to make the most out of BlockNote.

## Blocks

Each BlockNote document is made up of a list of blocks.
A block is a piece of content like a paragraph, heading, list item or image. Blocks can be dragged around by users in the editor. A block contains a piece of content and optionally nested (child) blocks:

<ThemedImage
  style={{ marginTop: "1em" }}
  src="/img/screenshots/block_structure.png"
  darkImage="/img/screenshots/block_structure_dark.png"
  alt="image"
  width={2000}
  height={2000}
/>

### Block Objects

The `Block` type is used to describe any given block in the editor:

```typescript
type Block = {
  id: string;
  type: string;
  props: Record<string, boolean | number | string>;
  content: InlineContent[] | TableContent | undefined;
  children: Block[];
};
```

`id:` The block's ID. Multiple blocks cannot share a single ID, and a block will keep the same ID from when it's created until it's removed.

`type:` The block's type, such as a paragraph, heading, or list item. For an overview of built-in block types, see [Default Blocks](/docs/editor-basics/default-schema#default-blocks).

`props:` The block's properties, which is a set of key/value pairs that further specify how the block looks and behaves. Different block types have different props - see [Default Blocks](/docs/editor-basics/default-schema#default-blocks) for more.

`content:` The block's rich text content, usually represented as an array of `InlineContent` objects. This does not include content from any nested blocks. Read on to [Inline Content](/docs/editor-basics/document-structure#inline-content) for more on this.

`children:` Any blocks nested inside the block. The nested blocks are also represented using `Block` objects.

### Column Blocks

The `@blocknote/xl-multi-column` package allows you to organize blocks side-by-side in columns. It introduces 2 additional block types, the column and column list:

```typescript
type ColumnBlock = {
  id: string;
  type: "column";
  props: { width: number };
  content: undefined;
  children: Block[];
};

type ColumnListBlock = {
  id: string;
  type: "columnList";
  props: {};
  content: undefined;
  children: ColumnBlock[];
};
```

While both of these act as regular blocks, there are a few additional restrictions to have in mind when working with them:

- Children of columns must be regular blocks
- Children of column lists must be columns
- There must be at least 2 columns in a column list

## Inline Content

The `content` field of a block contains the rich-text content of a block. This is defined as an array of `InlineContent` objects. Inline content can either be styled text or a link (or a custom inline content type if you customize the editor schema).

### Inline Content Objects

The `InlineContent` type is used to describe a piece of inline content:

```typescript
type Link = {
  type: "link";
  content: StyledText[];
  href: string;
};

type StyledText = {
  type: "text";
  text: string;
  styles: Styles;
};

type InlineContent = Link | StyledText;
```

The `styles` property is explained below.

### Other types of Block Content

While most blocks use an array of `InlineContent` objects to describe their content (e.g.: paragraphs, headings, list items). Some blocks, like [images](/docs/editor-basics/default-schema#image), don't contain any rich text content, so their `content` fields will be `undefined`.

[Tables](/docs/editor-basics/default-schema#table) are also different, as they contain `TableContent`. Here, each table cell is represented as an array of `InlineContent` objects:

```typescript
type TableContent = {
  type: "tableContent";
  rows: {
    cells: InlineContent[][];
  }[];
};
```

### Styles and Rich Text

The `styles` property of `StyledText` objects is used to describe the rich text styles (e.g.: bold, italic, color) or other attributes of a piece of text. It's a set of key / value pairs that specify the styles applied to the text.

See the [Default Schema](/docs/editor-basics/default-schema) to learn which styles are included in BlockNote by default.

## Document JSON

The demo below shows the editor contents (document) in JSON. It's an array of `Block` objects that updates as you type in the editor:

<Example name="basic/block-objects" />
