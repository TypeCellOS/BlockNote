# Editor Setup

You can customize your editor when you instantiate it. Let's take a closer looks at the basic methods and components to set up your BlockNote editor.

## `useCreateBlockNote` hook

Create a new `BlockNoteEditor` by calling the `useCreateBlockNote` hook. This instantiates a new editor and its required state. You can later interact with the editor using the Editor API and pass it to the `BlockNoteView` component.

```ts
function useCreateBlockNote(
  options?: BlockNoteEditorOptions,
  deps?: React.DependencyList = [],
): BlockNoteEditor;

type BlockNoteEditorOptions = {
  animations?: boolean;
  collaboration?: CollaborationOptions;
  comments?: CommentsConfig;
  defaultStyles?: boolean;
  dictionary?: Dictionary;
  disableExtensions?: string[];
  domAttributes?: Record<string, string>;
  dropCursor?: (opts: {
    editor: BlockNoteEditor;
    color?: string | false;
    width?: number;
    class?: string;
  }) => Plugin;
  initialContent?: PartialBlock[];
  pasteHandler?: (context: {
    event: ClipboardEvent;
    editor: BlockNoteEditor;
    defaultPasteHandler: (context: {
      pasteBehavior?: "prefer-markdown" | "prefer-html";
    }) => boolean | undefined;
  }) => boolean | undefined;
  resolveFileUrl: (url: string) => Promise<string>
  schema?: BlockNoteSchema;
  setIdAttribute?: boolean;
  sideMenuDetection?: "viewport" | "editor";
  tabBehavior?: "prefer-navigate-ui" | "prefer-indent";
  tables?: TableFeatures;
  trailingBlock?: boolean;
  uploadFile?: (file: File) => Promise<string>;
};
```

The hook takes two optional parameters:

**options:** An object containing options for the editor:

`animations`: Whether changes to blocks (like indentation, creating lists, changing headings) should be animated or not. Defaults to `true`.

`collaboration`: Options for enabling real-time collaboration. See [Real-time Collaboration](/docs/advanced/real-time-collaboration) for more info.

`comments`: Configuration for the comments feature, requires a `threadStore`. See [Comments](/docs/collaboration/comments) for more.

`defaultStyles`: Whether to use the default font and reset the styles of `<p>`, `<li>`, `<h1>`, etc. elements that are used in BlockNote. Defaults to true if undefined.

`dictionary`: Provide strings for localization. See the [Localization / i18n example](/examples/basic/localization) and [Custom Placeholders](/examples/basic/custom-placeholder).

`disableExtensions` (_advanced_): Disables TipTap extensions used in BlockNote by default, based on their names.

`domAttributes:` An object containing HTML attributes that should be added to various DOM elements in the editor. See [Adding DOM Attributes](/docs/theming#adding-dom-attributes) for more.

`dropCursor`: A replacement indicator to use when dragging and dropping blocks. Uses the [ProseMirror drop cursor](https://github.com/ProseMirror/prosemirror-dropcursor), or a modified version when [Column Blocks](/docs/editor-basics/document-structure#column-blocks) are enabled.

`initialContent:` The content that should be in the editor when it's created, represented as an array of [Partial Blocks](/docs/manipulating-blocks#partial-blocks).

`pasteHandler`: A function that can be used to override the default paste behavior. See [Paste Handling](/docs/advanced/paste-handling) for more.

`resolveFileUrl:` Function to resolve file URLs for display/download. Useful for creating authenticated URLs or implementing custom protocols.

`resolveUsers`: Function to resolve user information for comments. See [Comments](/docs/collaboration/comments) for more.

`schema`: The editor schema if you want to extend your editor with custom blocks, styles, or inline content [Custom Schemas](/docs/custom-schemas).

`setIdAttribute`: Whether to render an `id` HTML attribute on blocks as well as a `data-id` attribute. Defaults to `false`.

`sideMenuDetection`: Determines whether the mouse cursor position is locked to the editor bounding box for showing the [Block Side Menu](/docs/ui-components/side-menu) and block drag & drop. When set to `viewport`, the Side Menu will be shown next to the nearest block to the cursor, regardless of where it is in the viewport. Dropping blocks will also be locked to the editor bounding box. Otherwise, the Side Menu will only be shown when the cursor is within the editor bounds, and blocks can only be dropped when hovering the editor. In order to use multiple editors, must be set to `editor`. Defaults to `viewport`.

`tabBehavior`: Determines whether pressing the tab key should navigate toolbars for keyboard accessibility. When set to `"prefer-navigate-ui`, the user can navigate toolbars using Tab. Pressing Escape re-focuses the editor, and Tab now indents blocks. `"prefer-indent"` causes Tab to always indent blocks. Defaults to `prefer-navigate-ui`.

`tables`: Configuration for table features. Allowing you to enable more advanced table features like `splitCells`, `cellBackgroundColor`, `cellTextColor`, and `headers`.

`trailingBlock`: An option which user can pass with `false` value to disable the automatic creation of a trailing new block on the next line when the user types or edits any block. Defaults to `true` if undefined.

`uploadFile`: A function which handles file uploads and eventually returns the URL to the uploaded file. Used for [Image blocks](/docs/editor-basics/default-schema#image).

**deps:** Dependency array that's internally passed to `useMemo`. A new editor will only be created when this array changes.

<Callout type="info" emoji={"ðŸ’¡"}>
  <strong>Manually creating the editor (`BlockNoteEditor.create`)</strong>
  <p>
    The `useCreateBlockNote` hook is actually a simple `useMemo` wrapper around
    the `BlockNoteEditor.create` method. You can use this method directly if you
    want to control the editor lifecycle manually. For example, we do this in
    the [Saving & Loading example](/examples/backend/saving-loading) to delay
    the editor creation until some content has been fetched from an external
    data source.

## Rendering the Editor with `<BlockNoteView>`

Use the `<BlockNoteView>` component to render the `BlockNoteEditor` instance you just created:

```tsx
const editor = useCreateBlockNote();

return <BlockNoteView editor={editor} />;
```

### Props

There are a number of additional props you can pass to `BlockNoteView`. You can find the full list of these below:

```typescript
export type BlockNoteViewProps = {
  editor: BlockNoteEditor;
  editable?: boolean;
  onSelectionChange?: () => void;
  onChange?: () => void;
  theme?:
    | "light"
    | "dark"
    | Theme
    | {
        light: Theme;
        dark: Theme;
      };
  formattingToolbar?: boolean;
  linkToolbar?: boolean;
  sideMenu?: boolean;
  slashMenu?: boolean;
  emojiPicker?: boolean;
  filePanel?: boolean;
  tableHandles?: boolean;
  comments?: boolean;
  children?:
} & HTMLAttributes<HTMLDivElement>;
```

`editor`: The `BlockNoteEditor` instance to render.

`editable`: Whether the editor should be editable.

`onSelectionChange`: Callback fired when the editor selection changes.

`onChange`: Callback fired when the editor content (document) changes.

`theme`: The editor's theme, see [Themes](/docs/styling-theming/themes) for more about this.

`formattingToolbar`: Whether the [Formatting Toolbar](/docs/ui-components/formatting-toolbar) should be enabled.

`linkToolbar`: Whether the Link Toolbar should be enabled.

`sideMenu`: Whether the [Block Side Menu](/docs/ui-components/side-menu) should be enabled.

`slashMenu`: Whether the [Slash Menu](/docs/ui-components/suggestion-menus#slash-menu) should be enabled.

`emojiPicker`: Whether the [Emoji Picker](/docs/advanced/grid-suggestion-menus#emoji-picker) should be enabled.

`filePanel`: Whether the File Toolbar should be enabled.

`tableHandles`: Whether the Table Handles should be enabled.

`comments`: Whether the default comments UI feature should be enabled.

`children`: Pass child elements to the `BlockNoteView` to create or customize toolbars, menus, or other UI components. See [UI Components](/docs/ui-components) for more.

Additional props passed are forwarded to the HTML `div` element BlockNote renders internally.

<Callout type="info" emoji={"ðŸ’¡"}>
  <strong>Uncontrolled component</strong>
  <p>
    Note that the `BlockNoteView` component is an [uncontrolled component](https://react.dev/learn/sharing-state-between-components#controlled-and-uncontrolled-components). 
    This means you don't pass in the editor content directly as a prop. You can use the `initialContent` option in the `useCreateBlockNote` hook to set the initial content of the editor (similar to the `defaultValue` prop in a regular React `<textarea>`).
  </p>
  <p>
    BlockNote handles the complexities and performance optimizations of managing editor state internally. You can interact with the editor content using the [Editor API](/docs/editor-api).
