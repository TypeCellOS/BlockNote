# Editor Setup

You can customize your editor when you instantiate it. Let's take a closer looks at the basic methods and components to set up your BlockNote editor.

## `useCreateBlockNote` hook

Create a new `BlockNoteEditor` by calling the `useCreateBlockNote` hook. This instantiates a new editor and its required state. You can later interact with the editor using the Editor API and pass it to the `BlockNoteView` component.

```ts
function useCreateBlockNote(
  options?: BlockNoteEditorOptions,
  deps?: React.DependencyList = [],
): BlockNoteEditor;

type BlockNoteEditorOptions = {
  initialContent?: PartialBlock[];
  domAttributes?: Record<string, string>;
  defaultStyles?: boolean;
  uploadFile?: (file: File) => Promise<string>;
  collaboration?: CollaborationOptions;
  schema?: BlockNoteSchema;
};
```

The hook takes two optional parameters:

**options:** An object containing options for the editor:

`initialContent:` The content that should be in the editor when it's created, represented as an array of [partial block objects](/docs/manipulating-blocks#partial-blocks).

`domAttributes:` An object containing HTML attributes that should be added to various DOM elements in the editor. See [Adding DOM Attributes](/docs/theming#adding-dom-attributes) for more.

`defaultStyles`: Whether to use the default font and reset the styles of `<p>`, `<li>`, `<h1>`, etc. elements that are used in BlockNote. Defaults to true if undefined.

`uploadFile`: A function which handles file uploads and eventually returns the URL to the uploaded file. Used for [Image blocks](/docs/editor-basics/default-schema#image).

`collaboration`: Options for enabling real-time collaboration. See [Real-time Collaboration](/docs/advanced/real-time-collaboration) for more info.

`schema` (_advanced_): The editor schema if you want to extend your editor with custom blocks, styles, or inline content [Custom Schemas](/docs/custom-schemas).

**deps:** Dependency array that's internally passed to `useMemo`. A new editor will only be created when this array changes.

  <strong>Manually creating the editor (`BlockNoteEditor.create`)</strong>
  <p>
    The `useCreateBlockNote` hook is actually a simple `useMemo` wrapper around
    the `BlockNoteEditor.create` method. You can use this method directly if you
    want to control the editor lifecycle manually. For example, we do this in
    the [Saving & Loading example](/examples/basic/saving-loading) to delay the
    editor creation until some content has been fetched from an external data
    source.

## Rendering the Editor with `<BlockNoteView>`

Use the `<BlockNoteView>` component to render the `BlockNoteEditor` instance you just created:

```tsx
const editor = useCreateBlockNote();

return <BlockNoteView editor={editor} />;
```

### Props

There are a number of additional props you can pass to `BlockNoteView`. You can find the full list of these below:

```typescript
export type BlockNoteViewProps = {
  editor: BlockNoteEditor;
  editable?: boolean;
  onSelectionChange?: () => void;
  onChange?: () => void;
  theme?:
    | "light"
    | "dark"
    | Theme
    | {
        light: Theme;
        dark: Theme;
      };
  formattingToolbar?: boolean;
  linkToolbar?: boolean;
  sideMenu?: boolean;
  slashMenu?: boolean;
  imageToolbar?: boolean;
  tableHandles?: boolean;
  children?:
} & HTMLAttributes<HTMLDivElement>;
```

`editor`: The `BlockNoteEditor` instance to render.

`editable`: Whether the editor should be editable.

`onSelectionChange`: Callback fired when the editor selection changes.

`onChange`: Callback fired when the editor content (document) changes.

`theme`: The editor's theme, see [Themes](/docs/styling-theming/themes) for more about this.

`formattingToolbar`: Whether the [Formatting Toolbar](/docs/ui-components/formatting-toolbar) should be enabled.

`linkToolbar`: Whether the Link Toolbar should be enabled.

`sideMenu`: Whether the [Block Side Menu](/docs/ui-components/side-menu) should be enabled.

`slashMenu`: Whether the [Slash Menu](/docs/ui-components/suggestion-menus#slash-menu) should be enabled.

`imageToolbar`: Whether the Image Toolbar should be enabled.

`tableHandles`: Whether the Table Handles should be enabled.

`children`: Pass child elements to the `BlockNoteView` to create or customize toolbars, menus, or other UI components. See [UI Components](/docs/ui-components) for more.

Additional props passed are forwarded to the HTML `div` element BlockNote renders internally.

<Callout type="info" emoji={"💡"}>
  <strong>Uncontrolled component</strong>
  <p>
    Note that the `BlockNoteView` component is an [uncontrolled component](https://react.dev/learn/sharing-state-between-components#controlled-and-uncontrolled-components). 
    This means you don't pass in the editor content directly as a prop. You can use the `initialContent` option in the `useCreateBlockNote` hook to set the initial content of the editor (similar to the `defaultValue` prop in a regular React `<textarea>`).
  </p>
  <p>
    BlockNote handles the complexities and performance optimizations of managing editor state internally. You can interact with the editor content using the [Editor API](/docs/editor-api).
