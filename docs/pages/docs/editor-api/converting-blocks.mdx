# Markdown & HTML

It's possible to export or import Blocks to and from Markdown and HTML.

<Callout type={"warning"}>
    The functions to import/export to and from Markdown/HTML are considered "lossy"; some information might be dropped when you export Blocks to those formats.

    To serialize Blocks to a non-lossy format (for example, to store the contents of the editor in your backend), simply export the built-in Block format using `JSON.stringify(editor.document)`.

</Callout>

## Markdown

BlockNote can import / export Blocks to and from Markdown. Note that this is also considered "lossy", as not all structures can be entirely represented in Markdown.

### Converting Blocks to Markdown

`blocksToMarkdownLossy` converts `Block` objects to a Markdown string:

```typescript
blocksToMarkdownLossy(blocks?: Block[]): string;

// Usage
const markdownFromBlocks = editor.blocksToMarkdownLossy(blocks);
```

`blocks:` The blocks to convert. If not provided, the entire document (all top-level blocks) is used.

`returns:` The blocks, serialized as a Markdown string.

The output is simplified as Markdown does not support all features of BlockNote (e.g.: children of blocks which aren't list items are un-nested and certain styles are removed).

**Demo**

<Example name="interoperability/converting-blocks-to-md" />

### Parsing Markdown to Blocks

Use `tryParseMarkdownToBlocks` to try parsing a Markdown string into `Block` objects:

```typescript
tryParseMarkdownToBlocks(markdown: string): Blocks[];

// Usage
const blocksFromMarkdown = editor.tryParseMarkdownToBlocks(markdown);
```

`returns:` The blocks parsed from the Markdown string.

Tries to create `Block` and `InlineContent` objects based on Markdown syntax, though not all symbols are recognized. If BlockNote doesn't recognize a symbol, it will parse it as text.

**Demo**

<Example name="interoperability/converting-blocks-from-md" />

## Export HTML (for static rendering)

Use `blocksToFullHTML` to export the entire document with all structure, styles and formatting.
The exported HTML is the same as BlockNote would use to render the editor, and includes all structure for nested blocks.

For example, you an use this for static rendering documents that have been created in the editor.
Make sure to include the same stylesheets when you want to render the output HTML ([see example](/examples/backend/rendering-static-documents)).

```typescript
blocksToFullHTML(blocks?: Block[]): string;

// Usage
const HTMLFromBlocks = editor.blocksToFullHTML(blocks);
```

`blocks:` The blocks to convert. If not provided, the entire document (all top-level blocks) is used.

`returns:` The blocks, exported to an HTML string.

## HTML (for interoperability)

The editor exposes functions to convert Blocks to and from HTML for interoperability with other applications.

Converting Blocks to HTML this way will lose some information such as the nesting of nodes in order to export a simple HTML structure.

### Converting Blocks to HTML

Use `blocksToHTMLLossy` to export `Block` objects to an HTML string:

```typescript
blocksToHTMLLossy(blocks?: Block[]): string;

// Usage
const HTMLFromBlocks = editor.blocksToHTMLLossy(blocks);
```

`blocks:` The blocks to convert. If not provided, the entire document (all top-level blocks) is used.

`returns:` The blocks, exported to an HTML string.

To better conform to HTML standards, children of blocks which aren't list items are un-nested in the output HTML.

**Demo**

<Example name="interoperability/converting-blocks-to-html" />

### Parsing HTML to Blocks

Use `tryParseHTMLToBlocks` to parse an HTML string to `Block` objects:

```typescript
tryParseHTMLToBlocks(html: string): Blocks[];

// Usage
const blocksFromHTML = editor.tryParseHTMLToBlocks(html);
```

`returns:` The blocks parsed from the HTML string.

Tries to create `Block` objects out of any HTML block-level elements, and `InlineContent` objects from any HTML inline elements, though not all HTML tags are recognized. If BlockNote doesn't recognize an element's tag, it will parse it as a paragraph or plain text.
