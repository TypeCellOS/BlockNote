# Events

BlockNote emits events when certain actions occur.

## `onCreate`

The `onCreate` callback is called when the editor is initialized.

```typescript
editor.onCreate(() => {
  console.log("Editor created");
});
```

## `onChange`

The `onChange` callback is called when the editor content changes.

```typescript
editor.onChange((editor, { getChanges }) => {
  console.log("Editor updated");
  const changes = getChanges();
  console.log(changes);
});
```

You can see what specific changes occurred in the editor by calling `getChanges()` in the callback. This function returns an array of block changes which looks like:

```typescript
/**
 * The changes that occurred in the editor.
 */
type BlocksChanged = Array<
  | {
      // The affected block
      block: Block;
      // The source of the change
      source: BlockChangeSource;
      type: "insert" | "delete";
      // Insert and delete changes don't have a previous block
      prevBlock: undefined;
    }
  | {
      // The affected block
      block: Block;
      // The source of the change
      source: BlockChangeSource;
      type: "update";
      // The block before the update
      prevBlock: Block;
    }
)>;

/**
 * This attributes the changes to a specific source.
 */
type BlockChangeSource = {
  /**
   * The type of change source:
   * - "local": Triggered by local user (default)
   * - "paste": From paste operation
   * - "drop": From drop operation
   * - "undo"/"redo"/"undo-redo": From undo/redo operations
   * - "yjs-remote": From remote user
   */
  type:
    | "local"
    | "paste"
    | "drop"
    | "undo"
    | "redo"
    | "undo-redo"
    | "yjs-remote";
};
```


## `onSelectionChange`

The `onSelectionChange` callback is called when the editor selection changes.

```typescript
editor.onSelectionChange(() => {
  console.log("Editor selection changed");
});
```
