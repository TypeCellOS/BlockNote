## Common types

Before we dive into the methods, let's discuss some common types used in parameters:

### Block Identifiers

The methods to access, insert, update, remove, or replace blocks, can require a `BlockIdentifier` as reference to an existing block in the document.
This is either a `string` representing the block ID, or a `Block` object from which the ID is taken:

```typescript
type BlockIdentifier = string | Block;
```

### Partial Blocks

When retrieving blocks from the editor, you always receive complete `Block` objects.
For updating or creating blocks, you don't need to pass all properties, and you can use a `PartialBlock` type instead:

```typescript
type PartialBlock = {
  id?: string;
  type?: string;
  props?: Partial<Record<string, any>>; // exact type depends on "type"
  content?: string | InlineContent[] | TableContent;
  children?: PartialBlock[];
};
```

`PartialBlock` objects are almost the same as regular `Block` objects, but with all members optional and partial `props`. This makes updating or creating simpler blocks much easier. We'll see this below.

## Accessing Blocks

There are a few different ways to retrieve Blocks from the editor:

### Getting the Document

Retrieve a snapshot of the document (all top-level, non-nested blocks) in the editor using the following call:

```typescript
document: Block[];

// Usage
const blocks = editor.document;
```

`returns:` The document; a snapshot of all top-level (non-nested) blocks in the editor.

We already used this for the [Document JSON](/docs/editor-basics/document-structure#document-json) demo.

### Getting Specific Blocks

#### Single Specific Block

Use `getBlock` to retrieve a snapshot of a specific block in the editor:

```typescript
getBlock(blockIdentifier: BlockIdentifier): Block | undefined;

// Usage
const block = editor.getBlock(blockIdentifier);
```

`blockIdentifier:` The [identifier](/docs/editor-api/manipulating-blocks#block-identifiers) of an existing block that should be retrieved.

`returns:` The block that matches the identifier, or `undefined` if no matching block was found.

#### Previous Block

Use `getPrevBlock` to retrieve a snapshot of a block's previous sibling in the editor:

```typescript
getPrevBlock(blockIdentifier: BlockIdentifier): Block | undefined;

// Usage
const prevBlock = editor.getPrevBlock(blockIdentifier);
```

`blockIdentifier:` The [identifier](/docs/editor-api/manipulating-blocks#block-identifiers) of an existing block for which the previous sibling should be retrieved.

`returns:` The previous sibling of the block that matches the identifier, or `undefined` if no matching block was found. Also `undefined` when the matching block is the first in the document, or the first child of a parent block.

#### Next Block

Use `getNextBlock` to retrieve a snapshot of a block's next sibling in the editor:

```typescript
getNextBlock(blockIdentifier: BlockIdentifier): Block | undefined;

// Usage
const nextBlock = editor.getNextBlock(blockIdentifier);
```

`blockIdentifier:` The [identifier](/docs/editor-api/manipulating-blocks#block-identifiers) of an existing block for which the next sibling should be retrieved.

`returns:` The next sibling of the block that matches the identifier, or `undefined` if no matching block was found. Also `undefined` when the matching block is the last in the document, or the last child of a parent block.

#### Parent Block

Use `getParentBlock` to retrieve a snapshot of a block's parent in the editor:

```typescript
getParentBlock(blockIdentifier: BlockIdentifier): Block | undefined;

// Usage
const parentBlock = editor.getParentBlock(blockIdentifier);
```

`blockIdentifier:` The [identifier](/docs/editor-api/manipulating-blocks#block-identifiers) of an existing block for which the parent should be retrieved.

`returns:` The parent of the block that matches the identifier, or `undefined` if no matching block was found. Also `undefined` when the matching block is not nested in a parent block.

### Traversing All Blocks

Use `forEachBlock` to traverse all blocks in the editor depth-first, and execute a callback for each block:

```typescript
forEachBlock(
  callback: (block: Block) => boolean | undefined,
  reverse: boolean = false
): void;

// Usage
editor.forEachBlock((block) => {...});
```

`callback:` The callback to execute for each block. Returning `false` stops the traversal.

`reverse:` Whether the blocks should be traversed in reverse order.

### Getting the hovered / selected Block

See [Cursor & Selections](/docs/editor-api/cursor-selections) to learn how to retrieve the block a user is interacting with.

## Inserting New Blocks

Use `insertBlocks` to insert new blocks into the document:

```typescript
insertBlocks(
  blocksToInsert: PartialBlock[],
  referenceBlock: BlockIdentifier,
  placement: "before" | "after" = "before"
): void;

// Usage
editor.insertBlocks([{type: "paragraph", content: "Hello World"}], referenceBlock, placement)
```

`blocksToInsert:` An array of [partial blocks](/docs/editor-api/manipulating-blocks#partial-blocks) that should be inserted.

`referenceBlock:` An [identifier](/docs/editor-api/manipulating-blocks#block-identifiers) for an existing block, at which the new blocks should be inserted.

`placement:` Whether the blocks should be inserted just before or just after the `referenceBlock`.

If a block's `id` is undefined, BlockNote generates one automatically.

The method throws an error if the reference block could not be found.

## Updating Blocks

Use `updateBlock` to update an existing block:

```typescript
updateBlock(
  blockToUpdate: BlockIdentifier,
  update: PartialBlock
): void;

// Example to change a block type to paragraph
editor.updateBlock(blockToUpdate, { type: "paragraph" });
```

`blockToUpdate:` The [identifier](/docs/editor-api/manipulating-blocks#block-identifiers) of an existing block that should be updated.

`update:` A [partial blocks](/docs/editor-api/manipulating-blocks#partial-blocks) which defines how the existing block should be changed.

Since `blockToUpdate` is a `PartialBlock` object, some fields might not be defined. These undefined fields are kept as-is from the existing block.

Throws an error if the block to update could not be found.

## Removing Blocks

Use `removeBlocks` to remove existing blocks from the document:

```typescript
removeBlocks(
  blocksToRemove: BlockIdentifier[],
): void;

// Usage
editor.removeBlocks(blocksToRemove)
```

`blocksToRemove:` An array of [identifier](/docs/editor-api/manipulating-blocks#block-identifiers) for existing blocks that should be removed.

Throws an error if any of the blocks could not be found.

## Replacing Blocks

Use `replaceBlocks` to replace existing blocks in the editor with new blocks:

```typescript
replaceBlocks(
  blocksToRemove: BlockIdentifier[],
  blocksToInsert: PartialBlock[],
): void;

// Usage
editor.replaceBlocks(blocksToRemove, blocksToInsert)
```

`blocksToRemove:` An array of [identifier](/docs/editor-api/manipulating-blocks#block-identifiers) for existing blocks that should be replaced.

`blocksToInsert:` An array of [partial blocks](/docs/editor-api/manipulating-blocks#partial-blocks) that the existing ones should be replaced with.

If the blocks that should be removed are not adjacent or are at different nesting levels, `blocksToInsert` will be inserted at the position of the first block in `blocksToRemove`.

Throws an error if any of the blocks to remove could not be found.

## Moving Blocks Up/Down

### Moving Up

Use `moveBlocksUp` to move the selected blocks up:

```typescript
moveBlocksUp(): void;

// Usage
editor.moveBlocksUp();
```

### Moving Down

Use `moveBlocksDown` to move the selected blocks down:

```typescript
moveBlocksDown(): void;

// Usage
editor.moveBlocksDown();
```

## Nesting & Un-nesting Blocks

BlockNote also provides functions to nest & un-nest the block containing the [Text Cursor](/docs/editor-api/cursor-selections#text-cursor).

### Nesting Blocks

Use `canNestBlock` to check whether the block containing the [Text Cursor](/docs/editor-api/cursor-selections#text-cursor) can be nested (i.e. if there is a block above it at the same nesting level):

```typescript
canNestBlock(): boolean;

// Usage
const canNestBlock = editor.canNestBlock();
```

Then, use `nestBlock` to actually nest (indent) the block:

```typescript
nestBlock(): void;

// Usage
editor.nestBlock();
```

### Un-nesting Blocks

Use `canUnnestBlock` to check whether the block containing the [Text Cursor](/docs/editor-api/cursor-selections#text-cursor) can be un-nested (i.e. if it's nested in another block):

```typescript
canUnnestBlock(): boolean;

// Usage
const canUnnestBlock = editor.canUnnestBlock();
```

Then, use `unnestBlock` to un-nest the block:

```typescript
unnestBlock(): void;

// Usage
editor.unnestBlock();
```

## Low-level APIs

### BlockNote Transactions

The `transact` method is used to perform a series of changes to the editor. It can group multiple changes into a single undo/redo operation. And it also provides a low-level API to read state and perform changes to the editor.

```typescript
transact<T>(callback: (tr: Transaction) => T): T;
```

`callback:` A function that receives a `Transaction` object, and returns a value.

#### Multiple editor operations

The `transact` method can be used to group multiple editor operations into a single undo/redo operation.

```typescript
editor.transact(() => {
  // Both of these changes are grouped into a single undo/redo operation
  editor.insertBlocks([{ type: "paragraph", content: "Hello World" }], "root");
  editor.updateBlock("root", { type: "heading" });
});
```

#### Reading state

The `transact` method can also be used to read the state of the editor.

```typescript
const isSelectionEmpty = editor.transact((tr) => {
  // What you return here will be returned from the transact method
  return tr.selection.empty
});
```

#### Performing changes

The `transact` method can also be used to perform changes to the editor.

```typescript
editor.transact((tr) => {
  // This tr is automatically applied to the editor when the transact method returns
  tr.insertText("Hello World");
});
```

### Executing ProseMirror Commands

The `exec` method can be used to execute a ProseMirror command. This is mostly for backwards compatibility with ProseMirror commands.

When possible, you should prefer the [`transact`](#transact) method, as it will automatically handle the dispatching of the transaction and work across blocknote transactions. Also, the `exec` method cannot be used within a `transact` call since they will conflict with each other.

```typescript
exec(command: (state: EditorState, dispatch?: (tr: Transaction) => void, view?: EditorView) => boolean): boolean;
```

`command:` A function that receives the current editor state, and a dispatch function to apply a transaction.

Returns `true` if the command was executed, `false` otherwise.

```typescript
editor.exec((state, dispatch, view) => {
  const tr = state.tr;
  if (dispatch) {
    tr.insertText("Hello World");
    dispatch(tr);
  }
  return true;
});
```

This will insert the text "Hello World" into the editor at the current cursor position.

### Checking if a ProseMirror command can be executed

The `canExec` method can be used to check whether a ProseMirror command can be executed.

When possible, you should prefer the [`transact`](#transact) method, as it will automatically handle the dispatching of the transaction and work across blocknote transactions. Also, the `exec` method cannot be used within a `transact` call since they will conflict with each other.

```typescript
canExec(command: (state: EditorState, dispatch?: (tr: Transaction) => void, view?: EditorView) => boolean): boolean;
```

`command:` A function that receives the current editor state, and a dispatch function to apply a transaction.

Returns `true` if the command can be executed, `false` otherwise.

```typescript
const canReplaceSelection = editor.canExec((state, dispatch, view) => {
  if (state.selection.from === state.selection.to){
    return false;
  }

  if (dispatch) {
    dispatch(state.tr.insertText("Hello World"));
  }
  return true;
});
```

This will insert the text "Hello World" into the editor at the current cursor position only if the cursor is not empty.
