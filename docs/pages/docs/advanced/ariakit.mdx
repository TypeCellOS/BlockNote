## Using Ariakit with BlockNote

[Ariakit](https://ariakit.org/) is an open-source library of unstyled (headless), primitive components with a focus on Accessibility. To use BlockNote with Ariakit, you can import `BlockNoteView` from `@blocknote/ariakit` (instead of from `@blocknote/mantine`).

You can fully style the components with your own CSS, or import the provided default styles using the CSS file from `@blocknote/ariakit/style.css`.
