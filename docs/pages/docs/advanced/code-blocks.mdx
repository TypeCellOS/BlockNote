# Code Block Syntax Highlighting

To enable code block syntax highlighting, you can use the `codeBlock` option in the `useCreateBlockNote` hook. This is excluded by default to reduce bundle size.

We've created a default setup which automatically includes some of the most common languages in the most optimized way possible. The language syntaxes are loaded on-demand to ensure the smallest bundle size for your users.

To use it, you can do the following:

```sh
npm install @blocknote/code-block
```

And then you can use it like this:

```tsx
import { codeBlock } from "@blocknote/code-block";

export default function App() {
  // Creates a new editor instance.
  const editor = useCreateBlockNote({
    codeBlock,
  });

  // Renders the editor instance using a React component.
  return <BlockNoteView editor={editor} />;
}
```

See the code block example for a more detailed example.

## Custom Themes & Languages

To configure a code block highlighting theme and language, you can use the `codeBlock` option in the `useCreateBlockNote` hook.

This allows you to configure a [shiki](https://shiki.style) highlighter for the code blocks of your editor, allowing you to tailor the themes and languages you would like to use.

To create a syntax highlighter, you can use the [shiki-codegen](https://shiki.style/packages/codegen) CLI for generating the code to create a syntax highlighter for your languages and themes.

For example to create a syntax highlighter using the optimized javascript engine, javascript, typescript, vue, with light and dark themes, you can run the following command:

```bash
npx shiki-codegen --langs javascript,typescript,vue --themes light,dark --engine javascript --precompiled ./shiki.bundle.ts
```

This will generate a `shiki.bundle.ts` file that you can use to create a syntax highlighter for your editor.

Like this:

```ts
import { createHighlighter } from "./shiki.bundle.js";

export default function App() {
  // Creates a new editor instance.
  const editor = useCreateBlockNote({
    codeBlock: {
      indentLineWithTab: true,
      defaultLanguage: "typescript",
      supportedLanguages: {
        typescript: {
          name: "TypeScript",
          aliases: ["ts"],
        },
      },
      createHighlighter: () =>
        createHighlighter({
          themes: ["light-plus", "dark-plus"],
          langs: [],
        }),
    },
  });

  return <BlockNoteView editor={editor} />;
}
```

See the custom code block example for a more detailed example.
