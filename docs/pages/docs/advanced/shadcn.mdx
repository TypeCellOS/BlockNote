## Using ShadCN, Radix and Tailwind with BlockNote

[shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) is an open-source collection of React components based on [Radix](https://radix-ui.com/) and Tailwind. To use BlockNote with shadcn, you can import `BlockNoteView` from `@blocknote/shadcn` (instead of from `@blocknote/mantine`) and the stylesheet from `@blocknote/shadcn/style.css`.

<Example name="basic/shadcn" />

## ShadCN Customization

BlockNote comes with default shadcn components. However, it's likely that you have copied and possibly customized your own shadcn components in your project.
To make BlockNote use the ShadCN components from your project instead of the default ones, you can pass them using the `shadCNComponents` prop of `BlockNoteView`:

```tsx
import * as Button from "@/components/ui/button"
import * as Select from "@/components/ui/select"

return (
  <BlockNoteView editor={editor} shadCNComponents={{
    Select,
    Button,
    ...
  }} />
);
```

You can pass components from the following ShadCN modules:

- Badge
- Button
- Card
- DropdownMenu
- Form
- Input
- Label
- Popover
- Select
- Tabs
- Toggle
- Tooltip

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  To ensure compatibility, your ShadCN components should not use Portals
  (comment these out from your DropdownMenu, Popover and Select components).
</Callout>
