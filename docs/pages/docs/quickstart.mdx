# Quickstart

Getting started with BlockNote is quick and easy. Install the required packages and add the React component to your app.

## Installing with NPM

To install BlockNote with [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm), run:

```console
npm install @blocknote/core @blocknote/react
```

## Creating an Editor

With the `useBlockNote` hook, we can create a new editor instance, then use the`BlockNoteView` component to render it. See below:

```typescript jsx
import { BlockNoteView, useBlockNote } from "@blocknote/react";
import "@blocknote/react/style.css";

function App() {
  // Creates a new editor instance.
  const editor = useBlockNote({});

  // Renders the editor instance using a React component.
  return <BlockNoteView editor={editor} />;
}
```

As well as `BlockNoteView` and `useBlockNote`, we import `@blocknote/react/style.css` to provide default styling for the editor.

  <strong>Next.js usage (or other server-side React frameworks)</strong>
  <p>Are you using Next.js (`create-next-app`)? Because BlockNote is a client-only component,
  make sure to disable server-side rendering of BlockNote. [Read our guide on setting
  up Next.js + BlockNote](/docs/nextjs)</p>
</Callout>

  <strong>Using BlockNote without React</strong>
  <p>It's also possible to use BlockNote without React, using "vanilla" JavaScript or other frameworks. [Read our guide on using BlockNote without React](/docs/vanilla-js) </p>
