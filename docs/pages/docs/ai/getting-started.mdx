# Getting Started with BlockNote AI

This guide walks you through the steps to add AI functionality to your BlockNote rich text editor.

First, install the `@blocknote/xl-ai` package:

```bash
npm install @blocknote/xl-ai
```

## Creating a Model

BlockNote AI uses the the [AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/foundations/overview) to standardize integrating artificial intelligence (AI) models across [supported providers](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/foundations/providers-and-models).

As a first step, you'll need to register a new model with the AI SDK. For example, for Llama hosted on Groq:

```bash
npm install @ai-sdk/groq
```

```ts
import { createGroq } from "@ai-sdk/groq";

const provider = createGroq({
  apiKey: "YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY",
});

const model = provider("llama-3.3-70b-versatile");
```

<Callout type={"warning"}>
  Note that this setup directly calls the provider from the client, and exposes
  your API keys on the client. For Production scenarios, a more common approach
  is to handle authentication on your own server and proxy requests to a
  provider. See our [Demo AI
  Server](https://github.com/TypeCellOS/BlockNote/tree/main/packages/xl-ai-server)
  for a Node.js example or check the AI SDK best practices.

## Setting up the editor

Now, you can create the editor with the AI Extension enabled:

```ts
import { createBlockNoteEditor } from "@blocknote/core";
import { BlockNoteAIExtension } from "@blocknote/xl-ai";
import { en } from "@blocknote/core/locales";
import { en as aiEn } from "@blocknote/xl-ai/locales";
import {
  createAIExtension,
} from "@blocknote/xl-ai";

const editor = createBlockNoteEditor({
  dictionary: {
    ...en,
    ai: aiEn, // add default translations for the AI extension
  },
  extensions: [
    createAIExtension({
      model,
    }),
  ],
  // ... other editor options
});
```

See the [API Reference](/docs/ai/reference) for more information on the `createAIExtension` method.

## Adding AI UI elements

Now, the only thing left to do is to customize the UI elements of your editor.
We want to:

- add an AI button to the formatting toolbar (shown when selecting text)
- add an AI option to the slash menu (shown when typing a `/`)

We do this by disabling the default FormattingToolbar and SuggestionMenu and adding our own. See [Changing UI Elements](/docs/ui-components) for more information.

```tsx
<BlockNoteView
  editor={editor}
  // We're disabling some default UI elements
  formattingToolbar={false}
  slashMenu={false}
>
  {/* Add the AI Command menu to the editor */}
  <AIMenuController />

  {/* Create you own Formatting Toolbar with an AI button,
    (see the full example code below) */}
  <FormattingToolbarWithAI />

  {/* Create you own SlashMenu with an AI option,
    (see the full example code below) */}
  <SuggestionMenuWithAI editor={editor} />
</BlockNoteView>
```

# Full Example

See the full example code and live demo. Select some text and click the AI (stars) button, or type `/ai` anywhere in the editor to access AI functionality.
