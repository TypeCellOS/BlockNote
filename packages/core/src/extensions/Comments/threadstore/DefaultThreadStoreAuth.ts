 * The DefaultThreadStoreAuth class defines the authorization rules for interacting with comments.

 *
 * This class is then used in the UI to show / hide specific interactions.
 *
 * Rules:
 * - View-only users should not be able to see any comments
 * - Comment-only users and editors can:
 * - - create new comments / replies / reactions
 * - - edit / delete their own comments / reactions
 * - - resolve / unresolve threads
 * - Editors can also delete any comment or thread
