   * The keys are in the format:
   * - Key names may be strings like `Shift-Ctrl-Enter`â€”a key identifier prefixed with zero or more modifiers
   * - Key identifiers are based on the strings that can appear in KeyEvent.key
   * - Use lowercase letters to refer to letter keys (or uppercase letters if you want shift to be held)
   * - You may use `Space` as an alias for the " " name
   * - Modifiers can be given in any order: `Shift-` (or `s-`), `Alt-` (or `a-`), `Ctrl-` (or `c-` or `Control-`) and `Cmd-` (or `m-` or `Meta-`)
   * - For characters that are created by holding shift, the Shift- prefix is implied, and should not be added explicitly
   * - You can use Mod- as a shorthand for Cmd- on Mac and Ctrl- on other platforms
   *
   * @example
   * ```typescript
   * keyboardShortcuts: {
   *   "Mod-Enter": (ctx) => {  return true; },
   *   "Shift-Ctrl-Space": (ctx) => { return true; },
   *   "a": (ctx) => { return true; },
