 * - Lifts nested blocks to a higher level for all block types that don't represent list items.
 * - Wraps blocks which represent list items in corresponding ul/ol HTML elements and restructures them to comply
 * with HTML list structure.
 * @param options Options for specifying which block types represent ordered and unordered list items.
