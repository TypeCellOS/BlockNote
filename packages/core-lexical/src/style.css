/*
This is an empty placeholder file, which should NOT contain CSS code.
It's here so DEV environment doesn't show a 404

- In DEV environment, examples/editor loads this stub file, but actual CSS is loaded from CSS modules directly
- In PROD environment, the actual dist/style.css file is built from the CSS modules
