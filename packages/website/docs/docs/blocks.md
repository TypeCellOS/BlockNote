# Introduction to Blocks

So, you've set up a BlockNote editor and your users can start writing content, organized in blocks. What are blocks exactly, and how do we access the blocks from code?

## Editor Functions

The `editor` returned from `useBlockNote` exposes functions to access and update blocks.
We'll go through the full API later in this section, but let's start with a simple example - logging all blocks in the editor whenever its contents change:

```typescript
import { BlockNoteView, useBlockNote } from "@blocknote/react";
import "@blocknote/react/style.css";

function App() {
  // Creates a new editor instance.
  const editor = useBlockNote({});

  // Executes a callback whenever the editor contents change.
  editor.onContentChange(() => {
    // Get and log all top-level, i.e. non-nested blocks in the editor.
    const blocks = editor.topLevelBlocks;
    console.log("Content was changed:", blocks);
  });

  // Renders the editor instance using a React component.
  return <BlockNoteView editor={editor} />;
}
```

## Block Objects

So, BlockNote is centered around the idea of blocks. A block - like a heading, paragraph, or list item - contains a piece of content and optionally nested blocks:

<img :src="isDark ? '/img/screenshots/block_structure_dark.png' : '/img/screenshots/block_structure.png'" alt="image" style="width: 100%">

In code, the `Block` type is used to describe any given block in the editor:

```typescript
type Block = {
  id: string;
  type: boolean | number | string;
  props: Record<string, string>;
  content: InlineContent[];
  children: Block[];
};
```

`id:` The block's ID. Multiple blocks cannot share a single ID, and a block will keep the same ID from when it's created until it's removed.

`type:` The block's type, such as a paragraph, heading, or list item. For an overview of built-in block types, see [Built-In Block Types](/docs/block-types#built-in-block-types).

`props:` The block's properties, which are stored in a set of key/value pairs and specify how the block looks and behaves. Different block types have different props - see [Block Types & Properties](/docs/block-types) for more.

`content:` The block's rich text content, represented as an array of `InlineContent` objects. This does not include content from any nested blocks. [Table](/docs/block-types#table) blocks are slightly different, as they contain `TableContent`, where each table cell is represented as an array of `InlineContent` objects. For more information on `InlineContent` and `TableContent` objects, visit [Inline Content](/docs/inline-content).

`children:` Any blocks nested inside the block. The nested blocks are also represented using `Block` objects.

## Demo: Getting Familiar with Block Objects

Now that we know how blocks are represented in code, let's take a look at the live example below. We have a BlockNote editor, under which we display its contents using an array of `Block` objects. Feel free to play around and get a better feel for how blocks look in the editor, compared to how they're represented using `Block` objects.

::: sandbox {template=react-ts}

```typescript-vue /App.tsx
import { useState } from "react";
import { BlockNoteEditor, Block } from "@blocknote/core";
import { BlockNoteView, useBlockNote } from "@blocknote/react";
import "@blocknote/react/style.css";

export default function App() {
  // Stores the editor's contents as an array of Block objects.
  const [blocks, setBlocks] = useState<Block[] | null>(null);
  
  // Creates a new editor instance.
  const editor: BlockNoteEditor = useBlockNote({
    // Listens for when the editor's contents change.
    onEditorContentChange: (editor) => 
      // Converts the editor's contents to an array of Block objects.
      setBlocks(editor.topLevelBlocks)
  })
  
  // Renders the editor instance and its contents, as an array of Block
  // objects, below.
  return (
    <div>
      <BlockNoteView editor={editor} theme={"{{ getTheme(isDark) }}"} />
      <pre>{JSON.stringify(blocks, null, 2)}</pre>
    </div>
  );
}
```

```css-vue /styles.css [hidden]
{{ getStyles(isDark) }}

pre {
  color: gray;
}
```
