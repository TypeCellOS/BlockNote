# Project Members

## Purpose

This document lists individuals who hold formal roles within BlockNote (for example TSC members, maintainers, or other recognized roles).

The purpose of this list is transparency, not hierarchy.

## Listing Principles

- Members are listed alphabetically, based on the first word of the name as written.
- Members are free to choose how they are listed (e.g. full name, preferred name, handle, or organization), as long as the chosen format is consistent for that individual.
