[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40blocknote%2Freact.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40blocknote%2Freact)

**Welcome to BlockNote editor: a "Notion-style" block-based extensible text editor built on top of [Prosemirror](https://prosemirror.net/) and [Tiptap](https://tiptap.dev/).**

# Live demo

Play with the editor @ [https://blocknote-main.vercel.app/](https://blocknote-main.vercel.app/).

(Source in [examples/editor](/examples/editor))

# Example code (React)

```typescript
import { BlockNoteView, useBlockNote } from "@blocknote/react";
import "@blocknote/core/style.css";

function App() {
  const editor = useBlockNote({
    onUpdate: ({ editor }) => {
      // Log the document to console on every update
      console.log(editor.getJSON());
    },
  });

  return <BlockNoteView editor={editor} />;
}
```

`@blocknote/react` comes with a fully styled UI that makes it an instant, polished editor ready to use in your app.

If you prefer to create your own UI components (menus), or don't want to use React, you can use `@blocknote/core` (_advanced_, see `examples/vanilla` for a demo).
